# Learning Process on NLP and PyTorch
`Author: YUAN Yanzhe @Jackthebighead`

### Introduction
This repository records a self-learning process. It contains the following contents:
- **Stanford_cs224n_nlp**
    - in this part, there are learning notes, codes and papers during learning this course.
        - learning notes: 
            - course notes (combined with paper notes) 
            - material (that i read) notes
    - codes on assignments and experiments. 
    - papers read during this course
- **PyTorch-learning**
    - in this part, there are some models that I implemented while learning PyTorch.
        - models: 
            - model oriented (ML models like lr, softmax, CV models like CNN, ResNet, NiNnet, NLP models like lSTM based LM)
            - task oriented (in [nlp_tasks](www.baidu.com))

- nlp_tasks
    - in this part, I realized some nlp classical tasks/tools and wrote some tutorials (personal understandings) about them
    - it's still in progress...
