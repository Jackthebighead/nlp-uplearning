# Learning Process on NLP and PyTorch


### Introduction
This repository records a self-learning process. It contains the following contents:
- **Stanford_cs224n_nlp**
    - in this part, there are learning notes, codes and papers during learning this course.
        - learning notes: 
            - course notes (combined with paper notes) 
            - material (that i read) notes
        - codes on assignments and experiments. 
        - papers read during this course

- **PyTorch-learning**
    - in this part, there are some models that I implemented while learning PyTorch.
        - models: 
            - model oriented (ML models like lr, softmax, CV models like CNN, ResNet, NiNnet, NLP models like lSTM based LM)
            - task oriented (in [nlp_tasks](https://github.com/Jackthebighead/NLP-PyTorch-learning/tree/master/nlp_experiments))

- **nlp_tasks**
    - in this part, I realized some nlp classical tasks/tools and wrote some tutorials (personal understandings) about them
    - it's still in progress...
