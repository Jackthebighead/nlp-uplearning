we just purchas a home in gilbert and could not get anyon to refer an electr compani . all outlet on the outsid of the hous were dead and we could not find a reset for the <unk> switch . i found <unk> electr on yelp and sent an email on saturday morn about 8 am . by <unk> saturday morn <unk> had call and setup an appoint to check the problem . he came to our hous check the outlet , did some <unk> and in about 20 minut everyth wa work . he wa fantast and i would recommend thi compani to everyon !
after read a lot of review it seem like <unk> 's success rate depend on what you order . i 'd agre on that . by my friend 's suggest we order : -the rock shrimp tempura -the crispi rice ( blacken essenti sear tuna on top of crispi <unk> of rice with `` scream o sauc ) on top -the hot mess roll ( with scream o sauc ) -the miso black cod -a gin tonic -a green <unk> cocktail ( <unk> <unk> east , cucumb , <unk> , thai basil , <unk> , <unk> syrup ) -- - would die to eat again : 1 . the miso black cod will chang your life . the fish is insan tender and so tasti and the small sliver of skin wa so incred nom . my fri told me thi cod is marin for 2 week befor serv and it definit tast that way . everi littl <unk> of fish meat tast like a flavor bomb . 2 . the hot mess roll . that `` scream o sauc '' is super nom and the sashimi poke all along the top of the roll total hit the spot for me . i had been crave sashimi for awhil so thi wa love . 3 . the green <unk> cocktail wa delici . i 'm normal not a fan of cucumb but our waitress suggest it and it turn out to be a realli great choic . to be honest , bare tast the gin , which i would say is a small shame sinc <unk> is delici . -- - would eat again but would n't die for : 1 . the rock shrimp tempura . thi stuff is crack . it 's incred tasti and i can see myself <unk> eat it by myself in a dark room while watch <unk> but would n't board a plane to have it again . 2 . the crispi rice . i love the sear tuna but someth about the crispi rice squar did n't blend well for me with the consist of the sear tuna . i felt like my mouth wa fight to properli blend the two while tri to ignor all the hard crispi rice bit get stuck between my teeth . my friend realli love thi dish though so mayb it 's just my person prefer .
oh my ! i have never had a facial like thi . i had with a <unk> in the past so i wa kind of <unk> <unk> the same and i saw that it wa an hr long and kind of complaint in my head whi so long . when i wa there i wa think i do n't want it to end . <unk> wa my <unk> and she wa knowledg , kind , help , amaz ( to round it up ) she clean my face , clean it with a warm towel , massag my shoulder , part of my back , put some sort of mask ( with someth that felt like <unk> brush my face ) then put a <unk> , and i also got arm massag . got to love it .

the <unk> is usual a great hangout spot for my friend and i , and usual the staff is awesom . thi past sunday i went in with 4 in my group . my server wa <unk> and immedi we were greet with an angri hello . all she said after that wa `` drink ? '' . we all order a round of beer ( which we had to repeat the name of at least 3 time ) and wait for our drink while she talk bad about anoth server on duti not even 5 feet from the tabl . we could hear all the <unk> she drop within those 10 minut of our drink be deliv . after that she hardli check on us , and when she did , she wasnt friendli . i ask her for anoth beer and she <unk> someth under her breath and ask me to say it again <unk> . so instead deal with an attitud like that i ask for the bill , paid , and left . nobodi should have to deal with that when be serv . possibl the worst experi i 've had at a bar and definit my worst experi here . i 'm <unk> whether or not to even come back .
i met up with some work friend for some food and drink , and thi place wa definit a great choic for dinner . their tapa select is huge , and it 's so hard to decid what you want to eat . i eventu settl on the chicken spring roll and the salmon dumpl . they were both crunchi , cook to perfect , and pipe hot . i love everi bit of what i ate . i also tri some of the <unk> <unk> roll my friend order and wa a littl <unk> that i did n't order them for myself . they also have a pretti decent size wine menu , though i end up get the <unk> 's bite to drink . it wa pure alcohol . the wait staff wa incred friendli . our waitress did n't speak english veri well , but she wa still veri attent and did her best to help us pick thing out on the menu . our plate were clear away pretti much the minut we were finish with them , and the price were beyond reason . i would definit come back !
<unk> bill 's pub ha a pub type atmospher with a great beer select and qualiti food . the first thing i 'm oblig to mention is the beer <unk> . thi pub ha so mani differ beer ( in bottl ) that they challeng you to drink 80 beer and they will add your name to the wall . overal not too difficult a challeng if you have the time and the money . it end up be a fun challeng between friend or some excus to regularli meet up for beer with your friend . next i have to talk about the food . a lot of the review for the food on thi page is for the older menu and not the more updat and delici menu . i believ the food is of a qualiti much better than the averag pub although you will have to pay a bit more for that pleasur . i would recommend the burger ( especi when it 's on special ) and the wing ( also when they 're on special ) . i had a salad onc ( although it wa so long ago i can not rememb which exactli ) and it wa veri delici . overal i do n't think you 'll be too disappoint . also , look for the live music whenev there is some type of holiday around !

the food is n't veri fresh and is overpr . the menu is veri similar to costa vida but costa vida is a lot more fresh and the custom servic is much better . i would not recommend it .
well that 's a rather excel place to get a great dinner . . well , i guess <unk> you like mexican food .

i would give them a zero . the servic guy chad wa unprofession and all he did wa tri and hard sale the whole time . came out for a <unk> mainten and found all these problem . it 's 3 year old and they put it in . you know the commerci where they say we do n't sell you servic you do n't need well they 're talk about thi compani . if they call to mainten your air system , do n't do it . they want to charg me <unk> for a sale call not an air condition check . dont let them ruin your day or rip you off !

so far i 've ate here 3 time . the first wa an okay experi with the staff and i had the chicken pesto pizza which wa alright , but kinda dri . the second time wa take out and the experi with the staff wa slow and <unk> . the third time wa the worst and last time i will be eat here . i dine in and had the turkey and avocado salad with no tomato ( person prefer , no allergi ) . my sister wa with me and order the same . it took 30 min for her food to come out and it end up have tomato on the salad . no silverwar wa provid and when we ask for it , it took quit some time to be provid . my food howev took 45 min to come out and did n't have tomato but it also did n't have avocado - which is part of the name of the salad . i onli had an hour lunch sinc it wa dure work hour and end up ask them to box it to go and ad avocado . the staff did n't seem to care that the food took way longer than it should have and the guy who box my food seem put out that i request avocado to be ad when box . needless to say , i wo n't be eat here for a while , or ever again if i do n't have to !
i just return from a weekend trip to la vega and stay at aria . i wa realli excit as i heard it wa a great hotel and wa highli recommend by my friend and famili . at first i wa total <unk> with the place . visual it wa beauti and we were taken <unk> by the size of the bathroom . howev when i went to take a shower i notic a pile of blond hair stuck to the wall of the shower . now , i am a girl and i understand we <unk> hair , howev you would think that the housekeep staff would clean the bathroom wall . we call to complain about the hair and the staff wa realli friendli and said that they would come take care of the situat . that even we came back to our room to find the hair still on the wall of the shower . thi time we went down to the front desk to complain but all they did wa type the complaint in the comput and said they will take care of it . in the end , noth wa taken care of , . we found a ladi in the hallway who wa deal with <unk> servic , show her the hair , and even though she wasnt a housekeep , clean the mess for us out of the kind of her heart . needless to say i wa slightli disgust everytim i went to shower . the tub look so invit , but never in a million year would i recommend it becaus i am unsur about the cleanli of the state of the bathroom .
i 'm still annoy with whoever the <unk> idiot were who were work that day . to think i actual tip you mani time is embarrass . pathet

i found thi place on yelp dure my trip to vega and i had to make one last stop here befor i drove back to california ! i got the <unk> creami udon , while my boyfriend got the beef . i wa a huge fan of the <unk> udon ! it ha a slight seafood tast to it , but it wa n't too overpow . servic wa friendli as well ! we did n't know about the yelp check in for drink until after we had paid for our food , but the cashier let us redeem it anyway ( most place would n't allow that in my experi ) . dure our meal , the employe would come by to check up on us , which doe n't happen most of the time at <unk> restaur . i will definit be come back to thi place everytim i 'm in vega ! : )

a nice littl dog park that ha bench , <unk> tabl , shade , and water . most of the park is dirt with grass around the <unk> . i 'd rather see the opposit , more grass than dirt . peopl do n't seem to pick up after their dog as i went around with the <unk> <unk> and pick up 3 larg load of wast without even tri . sever wast <unk> are provid with sever <unk> <unk> avail for patron . wast bag are also provid near the entranc . access is via doubl gate to keep dog from escap . i like the bowl built into the ground that are fed with water bubbl up from below with which dog can get a drink .
super cool old school bar . cute cute decor . but it 's definit a bit messi . the cold drink are pile up in a small refriger below the bar . it look a littl like a cheap conveni store . but , do n't sweat the small stuff , right ? the cooki and the <unk> and coffe are delici . it 's in a fantast locat , right next to the fli fig and across the street from great lake breweri . all place i 've been die to tri . come here for a nice sip of coffe after go to the clinic and befor dinner is just the perfect stress <unk> . not my favorit cup of joe , but definit the locat and ambienc make up for whatev the <unk> lack .

<unk> . went for a girl dinner recent . everyth wa chill and tasti . highlight for me were the lighter , smaller plate . great for share . <unk> salad and <unk> chees <unk> . they pace thing well and server wa kind . a bit slow at the start and they had no ginger beer . wine list is great and creativ . not funki or cool realli . more of a grown up , if slightli laid back vibe . the light is warm and romant , with wine line the wall . older crowd . good place for take parent or colleagu . also work well for girl chat , which is what we were up to . would go again but not in a crazi rush . nice place to have on the <unk> for when you fanci a wine orient meal .
came here on a pretti quiet tuesday . bartend are super nice and made great drink . definit worth the trip from the strip . one of the highlight of our vega trip .
i recent visit the oliv garden locat in <unk> . i have to say that thi wa the absolut worst visit i have ever had in all of my year dine with thi compani . my mother and i exchang our soup do salad as we have done in the past never think it wa a problem , well we were most definit wrong ! when the server by the name of <unk> came back to our tabl and instead of ask if we would like refil on our drink , which we need , he proceed to pretti much <unk> us about switch soup and salad plate . he said to us and i quot `` just so you know by switch plate i have to charg you , i knew it wa go to happen it happen all the time i normal let it slide while at the tabl but just so you know if you take ani home or ask for refil i will have to charg you '' and it wa n't said in a quit voic either it wa said loud enough so that other patron could hear what wa be said . i have never felt so <unk> while dine out ever ! ! there are way to word thing and get the point across in a polit and profession manner the way he handl the situat wa complet <unk> for and veri disrespect . we were so embarrass by the situat that we did n't even finish eat the soup or salad and request box to box our bare touch dinner . we allow him to box our dinner to ensur that he knew we were n't go to `` steal '' the remain soup or salad . thi experi ha left such a sour tast in my mouth that i will never visit thi particular locat ! ! if i could give thi locat 0 star for the servic i would !
thi is one of the best spot in town . the atmospher is fun and entertain . the staff is friendli and the food is phenomen ! tasti doe n't begin to describ it . as far as price goe , you 'll save a heap and not go home hungri for lunch ! the gumbo is fabul and the mac and chees is a definit yum !
in my recent quest for montreal 's best ramen place <unk> <unk> wa first on the to do list due to the amaz yelp . unfortun , the few time we tri to get in thi winter the line - up wa way to long . last night , howev , wa the perfect opportun and we were seat immedi in a new section of the restaur call <unk> <unk> . so good news for all the <unk> like me who hate long line . now is your chanc to tri thi combin ramen hous and izakaya as they have plenti of seat . even better there is now a cool bar serv up veri nice drink where you can sampl the best of the ramen option and order off of the menu from the new izakaya . i complement the design and the decor of thi entir restaur . it is authent and at the same time ha a cool industri look that 's <unk> to one of the <unk> set that you might find on one of the food channel . i think they went all out on their kitchen which you can see as you are serv in the izakaya part . it 's simpli great . as for the food , the ramen live up to all of the great review . it wa absolut delici and total authent . the noodl were of the highest qualiti and the savori and creami broth wa except . clearli the ramen bowl here are made with a lot of care and love . the izakaya item that we order were beauti present and had everyth you would expect of the tast of real japanes cuisin . the avocado and salmon salad tartar wa just plain yummi and realli pleas as it wa serv on a glass block . it also contain some of the tastiest and <unk> japanes rice chip that i 've ever had . we also consum a smoke salmon salad , art present with a great varieti of lettuc and veggi on the plate , as well as <unk> chunk of in-hous on demand smoke salmon . the fri chicken <unk> wa right on the money and should be enter in a <unk> competit . we went easi on the japanes tapa so there wa room for dessert . we chose a green tea <unk> and a play on ice cream and waffl <unk> <unk> and green tea ice cream . both were satisfi , unusu and pleas to the eye which is a good thing when one opt for dessert . <unk> thi is the best japanes place in montreal . it afford , cool and hip . the staff were realli friendli and they tri veri hard to pleas . new york ha <unk> and quit a few other japanes great and i 'm happi to say now montreal ha thi place . i hope you <unk> out there will be kind enough not to <unk> thi place after thi and the mani other great review as i 'm hope there will be a place for me when i return sometim veri soon .
<unk> is a great concept that pittsburgh need ! order at the <unk> realli <unk> the process and allow guest to build their meal or snack exactli the way that they want . i order from the <unk> : yogurt , dri <unk> , blueberri , <unk> , and <unk> top with <unk> honey . absolut delici ! the littl <unk> touch also make <unk> charm -- such as the <unk> messag board and the <unk> napkin .
i search long and hard to find a good sushi place in pittsburgh and final found it the day i left . thi place wa great , they were fast , clean and welcom ! jeff wa veri kind to me and we had a nice chat while i ate by myself . thank you for have great sushi that would fit in anywher in lo angel !
i enjoy stay at thi cozi hotel <unk> at the end of a small street . there is not much surround thi hotel within walk distanc , so if your plan to tour the citi , make sure and plan on get an uber ride or taxi lift . some of the thing you first notic walk in , is the small intim lobbi with a staff member smile , wait to assist you . you will also notic the free chocol tray to your left of the registr counter and cooki to the right . also if you ask nice , the staff provid , cold and room temperatur , complimentari bottl water . i also think they provid coffe around the <unk> for free . the room are okay . fairli clean , but not veri spaciou . the bathroom howev is a comfort size . the pillow on the other hand are horribl , so i would highli recommend you bring your own pillow . the second you put your head down it <unk> out and the `` <unk> '' goe somewher els ! it defeat the purpos of tri to lay your head on someth soft . lastli , thi hotel doe offer a complimentari breakfast . i believ it start at 7:30 am and run till <unk> am . the time i 've been here it ha alway been the same : <unk> and gravi <unk> that you make yourself <unk> sausag <unk> and chees omelett <unk> <unk> <unk> juic <unk> for the most part it 's all pretti decent tast food , with the except of the chees omelett . p. . thi facil doe offer a busi and fit center .
fresco is definit one of the tastiest restaur in madison . it is a great place for a romant meal or if you have friend in town look for a more refin meal . the view are great , and be abl to walk out and about the garden area is quit love in the summer month . i alway highli recommend the restaur to anyon visit the area . i want to give major prop to the restaur and it 's staff for deal with a potenti frustrat situat thi past week . my parent were in town , and i 've been want to show them how awesom fresco is . i made a reserv for 3 at <unk> , but , as it is a pretti small restaur , our tabl wa tie up until about <unk> . the hostess wa genuin apologet and wa abl to <unk> us 3 seat at the bar . she let us know that we were welcom to order whatev appet we want for free . sinc we were kinda hungri , we got our free appet , and then also order a 2nd , along with some drink . eventu we got our tabl and had an awesom meal . when the bill final came , we check the number and found that we were n't charg at all for our item at the bar ! 2 appet and 3 drink for free ! my parent and i are pretti <unk> peopl and were in no hurri to get seat , so the complimentari beverag and food were greatli appreci ! long stori short : i . love . fresco . though i am a bit confus that their menu state that they `` buy local , '' and none of their wine are from the state ...
at first i wa a littl bum when my husband pick the resid <unk> for our stay in la vega but it turn out to be a veri good stay for mani reason . it wa quiet at night so i could sleep and did n't hear the loud nois from the strip . the bed wa comfort . the shower wa easi to work and did n't run out of hot water . veri close , easi and abund park . walk distanc to monorail . ( save lot of $ on taxi ) free breakfast . ( they offer complimentari dinner buffet <unk> ) the full size fridg wa good for hold <unk> of water . dog friendli . i do admit the decor is n't the most excit but it seem veri clean so i wa n't afraid to sit on the furnitur like i wa at the <unk> where i thought i 'd catch a diseas or get pregnant from site on the furnitur . the onli downsid i can think up at the moment wa the free wifi wa slow in our room so we use a hot box . it wa a good stay i 'd return !
i work in the area and have tri almost all the place access within my lunch break . sashimi hous is more or less what i expect : yet anoth chines run sushi place with noth special , but you would n't mind come for a meal anyway if you want your standard fare . good amount of seat . pretti good servic ( for a chines place ) . i had their lunch special . it 's not the best <unk> <unk> out there . it 's not cheap or expens . everyth they do is just standard . which can be ok. with sushi place almost as common as find a starbuck , thi is a restaur that i would consid onli if i happen to be in the area and want sushi ( unless you want the crap from a mall food court ) . i will probabl come again . there 's onli 1 other sushi place in the area so not a lot of option if i want sushi . and the other place even more expens .
thi past januari i move into a build at john and adelaid and immedi start <unk> at the <unk> number of excel food establish around - <unk> 's , burrito <unk> , korean bbq and the closest yet , corn beef hous . last month the old hous wa <unk> and a sign went up say they were move to <unk> adelaid st w , in other word , somehow closer to me . now instead of a 3 minut walk , i simpli have to cross the street . it 's feel a bit like have your credit compani tell you they 've just given you an addit $ <unk> in credit . veri , veri danger . i 'm actual not sure which <unk> could ruin me more but i will say that i had a corn beef sandwich 3 day in a row after thi happen . after <unk> from my salti <unk> and find myself not in a dream , but instead in a <unk> realiti , i decid it wa high time i final wrote a review of thi toronto legend . the owner is a realli friendli guy that greet you in a way that make you think you may have been realli good buddi way back . i 'm kind of <unk> we were . he 's a good dude that is alway patient and funni , no matter how jam pack the place is . obvious , the thing to get here is a corn beef sandwich - pile high on your choic of rye with mustard and a 1/2 dill on the side - but do n't shi away from the montreal smoke meat as well . neither sandwich will challeng your <unk> of what salt meat can be but both are veri good , veri tasti sandwich . they tast the way a deli sandwich should . although i 've never tri them , the salad look huge and tasti as well so if you 're a veggi that get stuck here do n't worri . the potato salad and coleslaw tast in between homemad and pretti good <unk> . unfortun , the $ 5 after 5pm deal did n't make it to the new locat but the good news is the hour have been extend . they still have a pint and sandwich for $ <unk> though i believ . as i finish thi review i see that it 's lunch time . i can see the corn beef from my window ... must ... fight ... urg ... menu recommend corn beef sandwich - light rye , regular mustard smoke meat sandwich - light rye , regular mustard servic note you 're go to wait about 10 minut for a sandwich and if you order the bake fri ( pretti good ) it 'll be more like 20 . mayb call ahead for lunch <unk> . locat note just move to the ne corner of john and adelaid . use to be an upscal coffe <unk> so the decor is <unk> differ from what <unk> regular have becom <unk> to . lot of <unk> .
solid ! thi will be my ramen place in montreal . had the <unk> <unk> , portion wa just right . the <unk> 2 <unk> slice were thick and juici , the way <unk> should be . i finish the broth ... i know , not a healthi thing to do , but it wa so f @ # <unk> good , i could n't stop .
wow . sad to hear of <unk> close . a real dive but a <unk> lot of fun . i hope the <unk> complex they plan to build here goe through to complet . vega ha enough empti dirt lot and <unk> project alreadi .
ever sinc i met my husband he ha never shut up about how he use to work at a claim <unk> in seattl and the food wa super amaz . i wa <unk> to right a neg review and see it ha onli 3 star alreadi doesnt surpris me . first off our server wa amaz . secondli i guess the <unk> cornbread , muffin , honey butter , and biscuit are no longer a thing here . which wa a littl sad . we did it big and order some drink , kid meal , and 2 dinner plate . i hate hate hate send stuff back but my veggi were absolut soak in whatev greasi oil it wa cook in . sinc the manag <unk> near he wa realli quick to replac it with steam veggi . but the real reason for the poor review is over batter and super chewi countri fri steak . he tri so hard to like it but i even had a bite to see what the fuss wa about and i dont know if it wa over cook or just a horribl cut of meat but that got sent back too . total bust . all thi talk about how great claim <unk> is and we both had to be `` that guy '' and send thing back . he end up get the jambalaya to go . the countri fri steak wa taken off but had to pay for the replac which i guess it wa fair . but still a total let down . not go back .
pretti <unk> good taco , mi amigo . i 've heard that thi fun , littl taco joint is own by the same owner as <unk> ( locat a hop , skip and a jump down <unk> ) , one of our absolut favorit restaur in la vega . whi would we expect ani less qualiti and <unk> from imperi ? thi place absolut exceed our expect . the taco were veri thought craft with some love , complementari ingredi . we tri a wide varieti of their signatur taco and i do n't see ani reason to <unk> into the other entre option . the cochinita <unk> taco wa the onli land <unk> i ate that day and it had <unk> good flavor ; i especi love the <unk> marin onion . the grill fish taco did n't blow me away , but wa definit solid . i love the fri fish taco , but felt the shrimp taco wa probabl the winner of the day . famili said the <unk> <unk> wa a winner , as wa the guacamol appet we had to start with . their tap select wa great and we were abl to buy some ipa for the tabl . howev , i alway forget how expens vega is ( we are n't resid ) and could n't believ pay $ <unk> for a pint of craft beer . fortun , we came dure happi hour and were abl to <unk> our <unk> with some $ 3 <unk> <unk> on draft . final , we had to get dessert . their version of <unk> taco and <unk> were awesom and <unk> craft , but the gold <unk> goe to the <unk> with their chocol y whip cream dip . eat taco at imperi and becom <unk> yourself !
first time here , had a chicken caesar wrap and mango fresh brew tea . veri good lunch , fast friendli servic . the onli improv need i saw wa the young man <unk> the tabl wipe a particularli messi tabl onto the floor . your patron do n't want to walk through that nor do you want to have to clean that up at the end of the day ! right now they do n't have floor cover on that end of the restaur but it doe n't set a good <unk> . they have camera so they should be abl to review the activ and address it , wednesday at <unk> . the young man is go through train so he 'll learn sooner or later . still a five star in my book to the fast and good food for lunch , fresh veggi 's and chicken , but the caesar dress could have been slightli more than what wa on the wrap , but it wa still veri good !
thi is the new innov way to go in the skin care industri . the licens pro 's here show exactli their skill and profession everi singl time . <unk> is the best . she is an expert in her field and will provid you with amaz result ! ! also when it come to my lash extens <unk> is my girl . she is the best at explain the differ varieti of lash and also her techniqu is <unk> . she is veri good and take her time to make sure i leav with the best look lash for me !
thi place realli deserv like 4 1/2 star . for a <unk> place i do n't know that i 've ever had better . pretti much everyth i 've ever tri here ha been awesom . decid to go here becaus i want to tri the white chocol orang french toast . thi wa good but not awesom . mayb i had too high expect after read these review . i guess i thought the white chocol flavor wa too subtl so it wa more like orang french toast . i also tri kind of a duck benedict . chop duck <unk> with onion in a pastri . top with scrambl egg and tomato hollandais on top . so tasti ! onli slight complaint wa that the hollandais , although good , did not contain much tomato flavor . everyth about thi place is top notch which is what i would expect from a restaur at the wynn .
the day ha come -- i final found a good bagel in charlott ! ! ! yay ! although not a ny bagel , <unk> definit deliv . their bagel are bake fresh daili and you can tast the differ . they 've got sever interest choic , and i tri the rosemari basil bagel with garden veggi cream chees , which wa so good . they also have pumpkin cream chees , which wa <unk> tempt , but i thought it might be too sweet . delici ! they also sell delici item such as natur and organ peanut butter mix with dark chocol . they 've got yummi sound salad and soup . a great place to come for lunch , or for a dozen bagel on a saturday morn .
tri quit a few of their pizza ( thank to an event at the <unk> <unk> ) and wa total blown away . come from florida , i rememb pass a coupl <unk> murphi 's , but never order from them sinc they are take and bake . howev , after tri the herb chicken pizza , i becam extrem more open to the idea . the idea of fresh and not frozen , is the big <unk> for me too . great job <unk> murphi 's on creat some delici pizza !
i love sushi and thi is a good place to tri as mani differ kind as you can handl . the portion size are small so you do n't get full off onli one thing ... except the rice , onli order the rice if you onli want to eat rice it 's <unk> ! ! the roll are all quit similar but all tast super yummi : ) the seawe salad is fantast and not too big which make the perfect entré . the <unk> ' are pure there to get the job done and need to be flag down to get their attent . student get a discount if they pay cash and if they alert the <unk> beforehand and must show a valid student card at the regist . sushi come quick after it is order and tast veri fresh ... overal a good place to be onc you understand how to commun with the <unk> and a paper of ingredi of what is in the roll can be <unk> upon request . yum : )
i had gotten my eyebrow wax here befor and wa not 100 % happi as i had to go home and <unk> them myself to clean them up . but i decid to give them anoth tri . a differ woman did them thi time . i check them out in the mirror in the salon to check for <unk> but i obvious did n't look close enough . i have never had so much hair left on my brow after a wax ! thi is terribl . i ca n't believ i spent $ 12 to have to go home and <unk> and <unk> them myself . i will not be give polish a third chanc ...

i like the concept of thi place but the food wa not good . my daughter had <unk> bowl , which like other review have mention came with a gross brown sauc that had no flavor . the bowl wa bland . i had the <unk> bowl and it wa not good at all . it wa overli sweet and the rice wa mushi . i do n't think we will be go back .
food 's veri authent and delici ! decor is a bit over the top but if it 's your thing ... lol . again the food is amaz so i 'd still make the trip to the restaur even though it 's a bit out of my way .

the good yelp review drove me here . not sure whi it wa a good yelp review though . in fact , in my experi , it 's the exact opposit . pleas trust me on thi , do not wast your time go here . the shop wa extrem old , <unk> , and extrem unprofession . the shop owner wa extrem unprofession , use <unk> languag , could n't even give me a <unk> price or tell me how he ran hi busi . he continu got on <unk> as he wa argu with hi <unk> friend . i felt absolut zero custom servic and i felt like he knew noth about the busi world . i ask simpl question like , what 's the <unk> charg ? how do you charg here , base on <unk> rate ? to these simpl question , he could not give me a clear answer . he may know a lot about <unk> , but he certainli did not sell me on hi expertis or hi shop profession . i did not feel comfort leav my car there .
thi place ha a great locat . but the food rang from okay to realli bad . the <unk> is basic a small and <unk> <unk> on a wrap from <unk> . cream of tomato soup with basil is incred water down and bland . chunk of green do n't tast like basil . the steak sandwich wa the one thing we had that wa n't notic bad . oh - one more thing - our weekday lunch took over two hour !
definit better setup and select than a regular smart n final . the manag wa nice and help us find <unk> we need . great atmospher . i would definit recommend thi locat .
i want a <unk> japanes theme outing . we were go to <unk> butterfli and i did n't want to go to just ani normal sushi restaur all dress up . i rememb that <unk> 8 wa a bit more on the fanci side of thing we decid to tri it out . well . i sure hope the <unk> is better than their sushi , becaus the whole experi we had wa aw . we came earli and were the onli one in the restaur at the time but instead of get a tabl we get place at the grill - not a big deal , just weird <unk> . our waitress take our drink order ; i get the hello <unk> martini . which take over 15 minut to get ... we got our dinner order in befor it even arriv . when it did arriv it wa the best part of the meal . we order popcorn <unk> , gyoza , spici tuna roll and a mango roll . the popcorn calamari wa ok ... but it wa basic like eat deep fri batter , the gyoza had good flavour but the spici tuna and mango roll realli wa a disappoint . there wa a sliver of mango in two of the 6 piec , none in the rest . the spici tuna tast veri bland and a bit old . needless to say , we wo n't be back .
the snack are love but the servic is slow and unprofession , and we wait <unk> to long for our snack becaus onli one person is work .
everi time i 've been to thi locat they get my order wrong . it 's realli frustrat to drive from ohio citi to the closest <unk> , be thi one , and not get what you want . while the staff is mostli sweet , we 've heard the <unk> `` here again ? '' . and actual is even more ignor consid they still get the <unk> order wrong . you think they 'd rememb , right ?
so my parti and i went to liquid on the first tuesday they were open thi season . first off the secur at the aria did n't even know the day club wa open . the staff at liquid seem nice but there wa a total of 8 guest <unk> my parti at the club . they have plenti of loung area <unk> cabana for a busi day , but have to spend <unk> dollar for a pitcher to reserv a loung area around a unexpectedli small pool did n't exactli seem worth wild . mayb on a weekend in peak season it would be a cool day club , but it just wa n't for us when we went so we left after 10 minut .
a <unk> team of <unk> drive you to perform your best , no matter what your level . the <unk> also help make it , i 've made some <unk> friend and train partner through them .
my favorit place to find classic southern comfort food ! wonder price with <unk> portion and high qualiti food . definit recommend the meatloaf , meatloaf slider , and chicken and dumpl ! if you have peopl visit charlott for the first time i definit feel like it 's a <unk> restaur to tri !
pho <unk> ha been a great addit to the neighbourhood of jane and <unk> which is experienc a littl bit of a <unk> for restaur . it 's a famili own vietnames restaur that hit the spot if you 're in the neighbourhood . we 've been multipl time for lunch and dinner and the owner is alway courteou and help . the fact that i 'm a 5 minut walk away doe not hurt ! decor is modern and clean and veri comfort . they recent ad alcohol to their menu as well and a hot pot ( i believ it requir <unk> ) i 've order multipl thing but for me the <unk> of vietnames cuisin is the pho <unk> <unk> ( pho special , with all the fun bit of meat ) and they have a solid offer . onli reason for not give them 5 star is that i would n't say thi place is destin dine in ani way but it 's a great place to have in the neighbourhood and i wish them all the best .
is good tri the cilantro chicken soup it wa the best . i like it . is a small restaur but the food is good
thi is not the place to go for food . everyth on the menu is the same just wrap up in a differ packag with no flavor or sauc . nice patio for <unk> wateri margarita .
ca n't beat it when you stumbl on a great meal . a bit <unk> when we enter ... full and happi when we left . seafood wa fresh and delici and the staff wa veri pleasant . highli recommend if look for a great seafood meal in vega .
as a busi owner myself , i am quit particular about custom servic . it can be difficult to find these day but lv nutrit center <unk> it . i wa offer help but then allow to <unk> at my own speed without addit pressur . they had everyth i <unk> at fair price . great convers upon checkout realli made me feel welcom .

i brought my 3 <unk> box and <unk> to the <unk> store and request to speak to the manag ... brian <unk> came out and listen to the problem i wa have . he ask if he could review my account and at least tri to keep my internet busi ? i told him i would appreci it . he ask if i would like to wait or i would prefer to be call . i ask him to call me . brian call me within the time frame he said he would . he help me with a resolut that wa posit . i am still a cox custom for internet . it is pure becaus of the effort and resolv of brian <unk> at the <unk> store . i give brian a person 5 star rate . i also receiv a respons to my facebook post on cox 's page to messag them privat to see about a resolut . the sad part is that it take such neg effort to get a resolut . a 3 month set of problem and no one could help until i cancel servic ?
i have now been here twice , both time were absolut fabul . my latest visit wa a friday night . we were seat immedi . they had live music that entertain us the entir even . thi place is famili run and they 're alway stop by to make sure everyth is good . their servic is an <unk> the food : both time i 've been there the food ha been amaz . it 's my favorit restaur for <unk> , which is one of my favorit meal . the mix board come with 3 delici chees and 3 yummi meat . it 's also accompani by some nut , raspberri preserv , toast bread , littl pickl and a light salad . it 's <unk> . the bruschetta are all amaz , i 've tri all of them now and you ca n't go wrong . the <unk> ham bruschetta is my favorit though . on thi last trip we also order the roast goat chees salad . the warm goat chees is serv in bread , accompani by bacon , lemon honey and a light salad mix . it wa absolut perfect and the honey complet made the meal . if you have n't been here you 're miss out . great littl restaur !

i have dine at 3 restaur around thi locat and final went in to tri the donut . i do not recommend the donut hole , not impress what so ever . the best donut he 's are without a doubt <unk> donut us they are $ <unk> a dozen compar to $ <unk> a dozen at <unk> 's donut . now if you order the regular size donut they are huge ! would recommend the eclair that are cream fill . pretti busi on a saturday morn but the line went quickli . rememb - tip for <unk> 's , get the donut not the donut hole
went here with my girlfriend while we were on vacat . we also ate at <unk> and in our opinion , thi place is better . we had the duck <unk> and a steak dish that wa brought still marin in the sauc . the food wa phenomen and the waiter wa a sweet and funni guy . the ambianc wa gorgeou . highli recommend ! !

thi place is in a great locat - trendi <unk> . downsid is that on the lower level , down some stair so not that access if you have a stroller or , <unk> etc . it 's also a bit and realli loud - or mayb i just have the <unk> of be there a few time with loud <unk> ? i do n't know . the cooki and butter tart are good . i 'm go to assum it 's about the coffe and not about the food . although i wish there would be more wow factor on the sweet display and sandwich ( turkey and ham on croissant ) . had a sandwich and although i ask that it be warm , it wa onli slightli warm on top and not through . they do give you a nice big cup for your tea and at nearli $ 4 buck you appreci it and drink it all ! it 's a nice altern to other popular coffe shop and the folk behind the counter are love .
thi place is a <unk> it 's in a crappi part of town the layout is weird it 's full of bum <unk> and <unk> the bartend suck they <unk> about how great their steak are becaus they 're cheap ... not so much ... it is not all that i do n't give a damn how cheap it is ... just an all in all dumpi place ... .it 's probabl safe to say i will not be go <unk>

smith brother is a fairli new restaur that open in the scarborough area of toronto that boast have some of the steak and prime rib in town . we were veri interest as find an amaz steakhous in town can be pretti tough . we have a pretti big crowd that even so we decid to make reserv just in case it wa busi and sure enough it wa pretti busi . even with reserv we were made to wait for 20 minut at the front . onc we final got our seat , we were led to a separ room where there were were two tabl of 20 peopl each surround us . we could see that one side had alreadi their prime rib while the other side wa still get comfort into their seat . when the waiter came by , we were told that the prime rib were all sold out . as disappoint as that sound , we were a littl stun by the announc sinc thi wa a steakhous after all . after our tabl complet our order , <unk> minut later , we could see that the tabl besid us who order after us , had prime rib roll out left , right and centr . we did n't know exactli what happen as to whi they got prime rib after we were told that they were sold out . we all end up order someth for the even howev . sinc we could order ani prime rib themselv we went with the prime rib slider ( $ <unk> ) . with horseradish on the side , the prime rib slider were decent howev it wa certainli no prime rib platter meal . the meat wa slice <unk> and each slider contain about 5-6 piec of meat . it wa almost the equival of eat a meat sandwich from montreal <unk> the mustard . my mushroom soup actual arriv after the slider were alreadi all eaten . the mushroom soup although as tasti as it wa , wa pretti salti the further down one went . one could definit tast the mushroom fine pure into the soup but by the time one got to the bottom of the bowl , one wa reach for the water . we were not sure if we were suppos to mix the whole soup prior to eat but it wa quit a differ of tast from start to finish . i finish the meal with a doubl chocol orang mouss . it wa decent but realli did n't <unk> me through with ani wow factor to it . if anyth , it wa probabl a tad too sweet for me . for the real chocol lover , thi could be your cup of tea but for me it wa probabl fit go from a real salti soup to a realli sweet dessert . overal , it wa a pretti disappoint even . we ask the waitress afterward as to whi there wa no prime rib platter offer to us and were told that these item had to be order ahead of time . it wa too bad no one realli made mention of that when we were make our reserv . the problem with it wa like a <unk> retail store that went under , when a custom is there and they do n't carri the stuff that one want , then it 's highli probabl that the custom will never return to that place . it certainli did n't leav a good tast in our mouth . like the say goe , not too sure if we will ever make a return visit . one ca n't give high point if the food is n't there .

normal i do n't write review so you wo n't see mani other one on the websit from me but i do <unk> read other and i wish someon els would have wrote one about thi place becaus if you 're anyth like me you work hard for your money and you do n't like to throw it away which is exactli what i did with thi place ! i actual found thi place on groupon which normal you get what you pay for but that ha n't been my experi with groupon . i found my last eyelash ladi on there and went to her for over two year and she wa amaz she took her time everi time and they last forev . i wa <unk> when i <unk> out she move and had to <unk> find somewher els to go . normal my ladi would take atleast an hour and thi place had me out in under 30 minut and half of them fell out within day and the worst part is i ca n't contact groupon becaus they told me not to purchas the groupon and to just come in and pay them directli . so now i 'm not onli out the money but i have to spend more money to get these fix . also i can toler crappi custom servic if the servic itself is good but everyth wa terribl ! do yourself a favor and find somewher els to go . the onli reason whi i 'm give one star is caus it wo n't let me give none . thank you and good luck

i have visit as you wish twice , each time with my mom and favorit cousin . the three of us went in the first time not realli know what to expect but felt pretti sure we would creat masterpiec . not so much . first of all , about the place . the shop is realli nice - color , organ , and welcom . the employe are friendli and help and do a great job explain everyth you need to know on your first visit . even though the store is pretti spaciou , it can be a littl tight in there , especi when all the tabl are full and peopl are mill about select potteri , paint , switch out water , or ask staff for help . that said , the tabl are a good height and the chair are pretti comfort . be warn , though - if you have more than three in your group , a <unk> tabl will be a veri tight squeez . on my second visit , my cousin 's husband join us , and between all of our potteri , <unk> bottl of paint each , two bowl of water , brush , spong , and paper towel , we did n't have ani room to <unk> . thank , we did n't spill or drop anyth , but we came close . if you 're visit for the first time and have no experi pain potteri ( or paint anyth more than a wall , realli ) , and/or are lack artist inclin , here 's some advic : do n't select a `` <unk> <unk> '' piec . i know , all of the potteri is plain what . what i mean is do n't select a gigant plate or a <unk> box . select someth with `` guid , '' like the cupcak or robot . on our first visit , my cousin and i each select a <unk> box . we both had vision of creat masterpiec . in realiti , i end up with a black box with hint of blue and purpl swirl around . her wa no better , we knew better when we went back . i went with the dragon and wa abl to use the rais and <unk> area as guid for paint <unk> . it wa so much easier than tri to design someth on my own , and let me tell you - the finish product came out so nice ! so those are my two cent . have a girl ' potteri paint parti ha becom tradit for us and i 'm alreadi look forward to go back . even if your first potteri piec come out like my ugli black box , it 's worth it for all the laugh you 'll have with the peopl you 're with !

i realli like thi restaur and highli recommend it . it is one of my favorit in pittsburgh . i have been a few time now and the pizza is realli veri uniqu for pittsburgh and quit tasti . i share a <unk> eggplant pizza yesterday along with a prosciutto pizza with arugula . the restaur decor and menu ha a california feel to it . i think thi is a great date place ; famili dinner place ; and friend dinner place . i do n't understand how the review below do n't see how good it realli is . the servic is quit good . it may just be pizza and wine but they do n't claim to be anyth els and they are realli good at pizza and wine . i 'm not sure what the person below order by my friend and i spent $ 30 each with wine , two pizza between the three of us , and two appet . we were realli full by the end . also recommend : go to oh yeah for icecream afterward !
thi place is aw ! ! ! if you are look at move in here , save yourself the headach and do not leas an apart from here . there is onli one member of the front offic staff that is ever will to <unk> is done correctli here . if you have ani notic to enter your home , or a notic of ani valu that by law need to be hand deliv , they do not hand them to you or even tri too . they just stick it in the crack of the door and you got ta pray that the <unk> do n't blow it away or it doe n't fall <unk> will miss lot of import info becaus of thi . the biggest problem that i have had so far start a few day befor i went out of town for a month . i had my hard wire in wall <unk> replac chang becaus it quit work a few day befor i went out of town . after i went out of town someth happen to the ac unit and the <unk> that caus the apart to consist heat up and cool down the apart while i wa gone , reach temperatur of about 95 degre . when i got home i walk in the door and notic that the ac had quit work but the fan wa still run and blow hot air into the apart . now the apart wa stay consist between <unk> degre insid the apart . i call into the emerg mainten line to have it fix and they were unabl to fix it , and then proceed to leav me with a broken <unk> cooler that did not work either . i wa never offer anoth place to stay until i came into the offic complain about it again and even at that point it seem like they thought it wa a ridicul request to have somewher els to stay with me and my regist companion anim . dure the fix process it took that 6 day to fix the problem and not even onc did i get a phone call or updat about what wa go on . i wa even approach one morn to a loud bang on the door from the manag of the complex , and she ask what i wa do in there , and wa confus and upset that i wa in there . i had some of my electron for my home offic ruin due to the consist extrem temperatur of the apart and wa told that it wa a ridicul request to have them replac or fix at their cost due to their lack of initi to fix my apart . follow shortli after i receiv an outstand $ <unk> dollar bill from <unk> becaus the ac unit <unk> and fan had been run consist caus me to have power cost of over $ 22 a day . i have also ask to have a portion of that paid and that ha also taken week to even be consid . they will onli pay $ 150 toward the bill becaus they say that they were never properli <unk> notifi at all of ani of the problem until i got home from be out of town . they also are tri to charg me for my companion anim be in the guest apart that i stay in and say they had to give it shampoo and a pet treatment . my dog is hous train and never pee insid and wa onli in the apart at night when i wa home from work . there were no stain or anyth in the apart and it wa n't even clean . they tri to find way to not take respons for their own action . i spoke with one of the mainten guy who said he as well as i did previous burnt ourselv on the counter top from it be so hot in the apart , but yet it heat doe n't affect anyth or make the electr applianc run <unk> accord to the staff . in a long sens do not rent from here they do not do their job correctli or take respons for their action . i know have a power bill and electron be fix at my own expens . do not rent from here . you can not speak to the manag without an appoint that is usual a week or more out even if you are drop off <unk> that she person ask for .

i love thi place . the salon ha a wonder , trendi and comfort atmospher . everyon that work there is super friendli , and they will alway offer you water and there is alway a tray of cooki out ! never again will i let anyon except emili clair touch my hair . i move to san diego and i come back to phoenix to get my hair done ! she is the best there is . when i came to her my hair wa absolut fri . the last place i wa go wa use way too much bleach and liter half of my highlight hair had <unk> out last time i had it done . i wa in tear and thought it would take year for my hair to be soft and look nice again . emili clair fix it the first time i went in . i left so happi and i will alway be grate to her for save my hair ! i 've been go to her for a year now and i have never onc left <unk> . not onli is she an amaz hair stylist but she is awesom and we never run out of thing to talk about . love love love her and love love love the salon . you realli can not go wrong if you go to the root . my mom and sister both go there and have other peopl do their hair and they are just as happi as i am . i just ca n't say enough good thing about thi place . if your hair is <unk> and thin ( like mine ) , thi is the place you should go . i had brown hair and the place i went befor made my hair <unk> and <unk> , and when i switch , i stay blond , but now it 's a <unk> more <unk> color that i get complement on it all the time . plu it 's just as soft as my hair wa befor i start die it ( they do thi condit treatment that is like magic ) . plu their price are awesom , i 've been to place befor that charg way more and are n't half as good . five star is not even enough . i 'd give them 10 if i could .

first , let me start off that thi restaur is one of the best vietnames restaur in cleveland . it is a littl hard to find , but worth it . our server wa veri attent and spoke <unk> english , which most <unk> restaur lack . commun is key and they nail it . she recommend the spici beef noodl instead of the typic pho and it wa the most tast food i 've had in a long time . the broth had a nice heat and red color and the veget that came with it wa veri fresh . my husband got the beef vermicelli stir fri . he did not talk to me the whole time we were there , their food wa that good . we just kept eat . at first we thought the portion wa too big but when we start , we could n't stop . i will be come back to tri everyth . magnific place .
from the outsid , i wa unsur of the place as my partner brought me here to tri it out sinc i love korean food . onc we enter the place , it wa welcom . the tabl and chair do n't look so old as the outsid . the waitress wa attent and nice . it came with four appet which i love 3 of them . i 'm not a kimchi fan . i order soft tofu with oyster . i got three small oyster , definit frozen . i wa hope it would be fresh . it came with purpl rice which wa nice , but not hot enough . my partner had the chicken <unk> . it wa crispi and tender . i would have like to see it with some steam veggi to compliment the dish . it 's all deep fri then ! verdict : it wa just like ani other korean <unk> that i go to . noth special . it wa a drive sinc i do n't like in etobicok . if i 'm in the area , i do n't mind go there to tri their other main dish .

we love thi place . we have gone there at least 10 time sinc they have open . the food tast fresh , the place is clean , and they have realli nice employe . thi place is my husband 's happi place . they also came to my kid fall festiv and it wa a big hit ! !
stop for dessert after a play , around 11 on a weeknight -- 2 famili , with a total of 8 in our parti . we had sweet potato fri and a few dessert , so i can not comment on their dinner menu . everyth we had wa veri good . servic , howev , wa practic nonexist , although the server seem to be have a great time talk amongst themselv . we had to flag someon down for water refil , for our bill , to pay our bill ... you get the idea . but for a <unk> dessert spot right downtown , it wa a winner overal .
here for the first time and we are extrem disappoint . <unk> on tap 16 oz 5 buck . veri over price . pizza wa under cook and the cesar salad wa pathet . a veri small corn <unk> 12 buck no fri . just the sandwich alon . we will never come back again .
the slowest check-in servic in histori , the repres disappear after help a few custom here and there , be prepar to wait an hour and half to check in .
ok - i do n't get my hair cut here but the boy doe . it 's a <unk> hair place so do n't expect someth from a salon or barber . while the wait wa a littl longer than expect ( 20 min ) they did advertis you could check-in onlin so you did n't have to wait . the hair <unk> were veri friendli and pretti quick . good job on a hair cut at a budget price . not much you can complain about . for guy - <unk> effici way to get groom . next time we will be tri the onlin check-in though .
phenomen experi ! book the privat room for my bachelorett parti . the servic wa impecc and the food wa on point and beyond reason price for a 3 cours meal and drink for 15 peopl . the restaur itself is pretti casual and lack the ambianc that i would have like . anoth downsid is that there are no bathroom on site and you have to walk through the casino to get to the <unk> one . thi wa terribl for me as i had to use the bathroom sever time dure dinner and had on an <unk> that requir assist in order to do so . fault and all , i still think that you should consid thi restaur for a special occas or just a darn fine meal .
your basic airport with your basic airport grub and associ price . decent layout for a good size airport . free wifi would have been a nice touch if it wa n't too weak to cover all of termin 4 .
we went on a trip to <unk> , itali a few year ago and fell in love with their pizza style , veri uniqu . when we visit <unk> for the first time , our memori of our trip came back , they are exactli the same , fresh ingredi , amaz dough , just perfect ! i have to say that it is the best pizza , we absolut love it ! ! ! and the servic alway outstand , we will miss you guy ! ! ! !

i had a great experi with style nail . i got a gel mani and regular pedi . i had two <unk> work on me while i relax in the massag chair . the work did n't feel rush but wa done in a time manner . we 'll see how long it last but so far they still look great !
i ate at thi locat twice . if thi rate wa base off my first visit , i would have rate it <unk> . the downfal of <unk> is the inconsist . i ate the hawaiian burger on my first visit and found it juici , cook just right and not messi . the second time , the burger wa overcook . i want to tri thi place one more time to see if they can improv their burger .
great burger and awesom fri . for comparison purpos it 's about 1 step abov in ' n out but 2 step up in price . no shake ... ... which i think is a must with a good burger , me and my kid live sinc <unk> ha awesom shake just two door down .

food wa good properli season clean atmospher the staff wa nice but way overpr it 's a taco not a burrito i think it 's more expens than el <unk>

i wa veri disappoint with nearli everyth about thi cafe . in pictur it look relax but they have a noisi pop station radio play far too loud . the food is extrem overpr and the coffe is quit disappoint . i also notic there were <unk> in the front of the store which lead me to think there are more elsewher . i inform the server of the <unk> where she went to tell the owner and i heard him say `` what would you like me to do about it '' . if thi is how he plan on run a busi i feel truli sorri for anyon work under him . i got to talk to the server who wa the <unk> girl i 've met in a long time . she said she did n't want to talk badli of the busi or the owner but i press for more inform and she explain how the owner treat them poorli . he even take money from their tip which is downright <unk> . i would never in my life recommend thi establish to anyon .
delici sandwich . super nice staff . amaz price . thi is my favorit sandwich store in toronto . the owner is so nice , and take such great care with everi sandwich . it 's not fast , but it 's worth the wait . the sandwich and bread are delici . interest , but not <unk> . the price are amaz with everi sandwich at $ <unk> or less . i also love their soup and salad . i recommend thi to anyon who like to pay reason price for thing that are delici .
the food is alway amaz . my standard order is a <unk> with fri and a chocol <unk> sometim i 'll splurg with an order of cheesi fri instead ( i know there 's a secret menu , but i do n't like anyth but chees on my burger ) . while the food is great , the place is alway pack ( becaus , let 's face it , everyon love in ' n out ) . if you plan on dine in , you have to play a game of <unk> tabl . you know , place your order and then <unk> around the dine area wait for some <unk> custom to finish eat and then <unk> up their tabl ( prefer after they get <unk> you do n't want to be too over <unk> ) . crowd dine area asid , thi place is great and i look forward to go back .
<unk> ha been a <unk> ! in vega , the <unk> is basic done with rock . thu , i have had my windshield <unk> crack twice in about 10 month . howev , the manag here ( and my insur compani ) have made the replac process easi , conveni , and afford . i love the mobil <unk> it is actual all i have use ! i have stop by the store for advic for what i need and all of the worker are friendli and attent . their windshield are a littl more expens than other but honestli , they are well worth the price . i highli recommend !

awesom entertain ! two year ago , when we visit la vega for our <unk> , we were a bit disappoint that they were renov and big elvi wa n't play ( i believ thi wa when he wa at <unk> 's ) . dure thi past trip to celebr my husband 's birthday , i wa again sad to learn that he wa n't perform again . if you 're a huge elvi fan , thi is one stop that i recommend to place on your list of <unk> 's in vega . let me start with the voic . as a huge elvi fan in my own right , an elvi imperson , and own a collect of elvi <unk> , i say in my honest opinion , thi guy is better than most elvi imperson in vega . have been born in the 80 's , i could n't get to see the king of rock and roll in person . howev , after my wife say that thi guy ha solid review , i had to see for myself . i close my eye as he wa sing and i felt like i wa listen to one of the mani elvi concert i have on dvd . there were <unk> in hi act where he call up audienc member to perform and the audienc would pick the winner . i went up three time , and won all three ! ! anoth great <unk> of the show is where he would ask for request . i actual met him in the back and request , heart of <unk> . for those of you who are not familiar with elvi ' song , thi song is veri hard to sing ; unless you have the rang to do it from <unk> dure the vers and go up an <unk> higher with each <unk> ! he did it ; quit well although hi voic did break with the last <unk> , but i could n't blame him . that song is hard ! if you consid yourself to be an elvi fan , thi is an essenti stop in vega . happi yelp ! !

good food , decent ambienc , just not a place that realli <unk> great food . the panini is ok , the other food is as well . while the food is good , i feel that thi is more a bar first , one that serv beer and sport over realli good food . i do n't mind the place , but not on my list of great place to eat .
my friend work at <unk> and the compani that own them wa have a soft open of marque <unk> , and employe were invit as well as famili and friend . ( i think that 's what it wa ) . when we arriv it wa pack ! it start at <unk> and we got there around <unk> . we walk around for a bit , stop at the bar with our 2 ticket for free drink . i had a margarita and she had a lemon and vodka type drink . then we got so lucki ! she found someon she knew who <unk> us to a tabl under the tent . someon els came over and ask what we 'd like to eat . they sent over a tray of fresh fruit while we were order food and drink . ( i realli like it when i 'm treat like a <unk> ) . they offer us a bottl , but i wa drive and go to <unk> that night , i onli want a mojito . my friend want one too so they send over a <unk> of mojito 's . for food we had : ahi tuna over salad . the salad had cold <unk> snow pea . wow , insan delici . next time i see them , i 'm buy them and put them in salad . <unk> . there were cherri tomato , avocado and artichok in the salad too . the dress wa veri good as well . we also had the fish taco ' . they were delici too . we had a side of fri to and they were nice season . for drink : margarita and mojito . the mojito wa definit better than the <unk> . i dont like the fake <unk> stuff . they did n't use fresh squeez ( key ingredi ! ) <unk> juic . cheap tequila . no grand <unk> <unk> like a realli good <unk> ha . the <unk> wa better , and it did have fresh mint , but it wa onli ok . i guess we should have gotten the bottl ! the scene : lot of <unk> <unk> earli 20 's pretti girl take order and bring drink . they have male runner bring the food . lot of peopl , in their mid 20 's to earli 30 's drink . a lot . sinc most of these are friend and famili and employe 's i 'm sure thi wa tone down . a dj play good music . a tabl full of good food and drink . me <unk> ! i wish we would have gotten there a littl sooner and wish i could have stay a littl later . it wa cool . dj play music , ton and ton of peopl walk around drink . on one hand i did feel a littl old , on the other , if i didnt work that day and have to work the next , i 'd probabl be , no , i <unk> be one of the ton of drunk peopl . instead , i went to <unk> and had a fantast time at the elit event . i wish i could say i 'd come back here . but i wont . whi ? it 's crazi expens . we did n't pay to get in , or for the 1 free drink we each got . but the high roller cool <unk> we got came with a `` bill '' but it wa `` comp '' . for one <unk> of mojito , 1 ahi tuna salad , 1 side of fri and 1 order of fish taco 's the bill came to $ <unk> ! they wa no tabl charg , and i dont think i saw a fruit platter charg , and we did n't pay to get in or those drink , so , thi would have been , what , a $ <unk> day if we had truli paid for each and everi thing . get all that stuff wa great , i love it , and i 'm thank for it . i just would not spend my own money on that . if you have ton and ton of cash to spend on someth like thi , then you 'd probabl love it .

ca n't beat the price for the movi and food but i do n't think it 's <unk> for employe to make rude and <unk> comment under their breath when one misunderstand someth you say ( <unk> ) . proper procedur ( i would think ) is to go up to the custom and <unk> what you 've said a differ way . for exampl instead of say `` it 's to earli to let peopl in the movi , the prior show is still run '' mayb say someth like `` it too earli to let anyon in to the entir movi theater and becaus of fire code safeti we will need you to wait outsid '' . that way we do n't assum that we can walk in and wait in the theater itself and you do n't assum that my fiancé or myself will be abl to determin your max <unk> for fire code safeti .

( the whole bodi ) it 's amaz ! in addit to the flower , which are the main part of everi display , they also have prop . recent , they had a <unk> display around septemb i think and in addit to flower <unk> , they had huge rock , water , etc . just a head up , thi display get veri busi . there 's usual a flow to the traffic and you kind of have to wait in line to take pictur . i usual go in the even , so mayb i 'm alway go at the busiest time .

hous in the former hawaiian tropic space it appear that not much ha chang on the servic front . we stop by for happi hour which includ $ 3 <unk> draft and had to practic shoot a gun in the air to get a bartend attent . with the except of the lack of <unk> , the bartend are just as inattent , robot and <unk> as the former bartend at <unk> . with cheap beer flow like water on the strip there is realli no reason to visit the <unk> again .
i get <unk> even as i begin thi review ! i had heard about khao san road for age - but had been put off tri thi place due to the <unk> stori i had heard about long wait time and terribl servic . with that be said , i manag my own expect and decid to take the <unk> - and boy am i glad i did ! i 've been there a few time sinc , and here 's what i think : - wait time <unk> : so ye , the place is often pack - so rather than attempt to wait hour in line , i 've now opt to order my meal for take out . thi way , i can walk right in , order ( squeez a few neighborhood errand in ) and by the time i 'm back , my food is readi to go ! - servic & seat : noth amaz , but with that be said , i 've alway been greet pleasantli and have not had a bad experi yet . i can see how wait and be squeez in could caus some irrit to wait patron . the seat set up often requir share tabl . meh , i 'll take mine to go ... so , now to the food ... one word : unbeliev . i ca n't actual imagin go anywher els for my thai food offer . i 've been spoil ! i ca n't go back ! 1 ) pad thai - chicken with medium spici hit the spot . their chef 's special is the way to go ! 2 ) both red and green curri are addit and creami . 3 ) squash <unk> are uniqu and delight <unk> ! a must tri ! 4 ) my absolut favorit - khao <unk> . it messi , creami , sweet , spici and just the perfect bowl of good . hand down a favourit go-to dure a busi week when you need some good <unk> . the food is so good here , i can look past ani possibl <unk> in set up , servic and seat . trust me , you 'll agre .

i 'm in love ! i 'm in love ! and i do n't care who know it ! i walk into thi store and fell . hard . i wa that <unk> emoji when i saw the fresh seafood counter with beauti scallop . i turn into <unk> emoji when i fill up my <unk> with delici arizona beer . deep <unk> emoji when i wa eat my freshli scoop mint chocol chip gelato on a hot summer day . shut up , no i 'm not <unk> thi . organ , yeah they have that . gluten free , sure whatev . <unk> , okay fine . but thi place to me is conveni and commun and qualiti and a slice of heaven . if i had the money , i 'd eat here everi day . serious . a favorit of mine is the medium rare buffalo burger with grill veggi and a half avocado . my toddler enjoy the yummi cheeseburg slider with sweet potato tater tot . also great is the orang chicken with rice , the burrito with a spinach tortilla ( they have more option than chipotl ) , all sort of sandwich with fresh ingredi and realli yummi spread , and of cours the <unk> pizza straight from their brick oven ( which you can order whole pizza for ten buck on thursday , if you were wonder ) . there are some great fresh option at the buffet too . onc you get your food , pay at the northsid bar and order yourself a glass of wine or beer and take a seat at a tabl . we like to pull up a high chair from under the water <unk> for our son , and we 're all set for some <unk> peopl watch ! oh and they also have groceri .
i order from here becaus i had a <unk> . i will never order from here again . pizza wa bland and gener . crust seem like someth frozen , sauc wa non exist and chees and top were lack . no flavor . more like a flatbread . zucchini wa a veri small portion and most piec were hard and cold . wing were <unk> up and soggi and lack ani good amount of meat . fri were ok. like crinkl cut you 'd buy at the store . they gave me 1 ranch for everyth . also order a 2 liter of <unk> which came warm . food took over an hour to be deliv and deliveri guy did n't seem to want to accept my money . never again .
the roast pork wa crispi and is better than sam woo . the bbq pork noodl wa okay becaus the bbq pork wa n't great . the food is definit made for asian tast and thu authent . if you like sweet and sour then thi ai n't the place ( tri <unk> express ) . portion are huge so be readi to share : - )
food wa great here and the price wa appropri for the food . i got the hash brown and the chicken and waffl . everyth i had here wa amaz . the servic wa just okay here and did not match how great the food is here the server wa not attent at all .
i have n't gone to bath & bodi more than a coupl of time . i 'm realli turn off by <unk> product . but someon had given me a tini bottl of hand sanit with a peppermint scent , which i realli like , and i want to get more . whi you would want to pick up ani food with your hand smell like <unk> or <unk> is beyond me . the store <unk> are realli help ; they greet you as you walk in . they must work on <unk> , becaus when i check out , i wa ask if anyon had been help me . um , there were onli two peopl work , so if it wa n't her , it had to be the other one ! unfortun , that peppermint is onli avail at christma time , when they have it in their liquid soap , too . i suspect that , sinc the label is <unk> . but i did manag to find a coupl of scent that did n't make me want to <unk> , so i bought 5 bottl , to take advantag of the `` low '' 5 for $ 6 price . that should last until the <unk> shop season start - in august ?
thi is a review that is mainli base on the mini donut . i grew up feast on tini tom donut at the <unk> with my famili , so freshli made and sugar coat mini donut hold a <unk> part in my mind space . unfortun , i am a <unk> , so i do n't have easi access to the tini tom donut shop in markham . that 's where littl <unk> 's coffe come into the pictur . it is locat in an <unk> corner of a build near <unk> theatr . the onli notic <unk> is the direct <unk> that is paint on one side of the build , so you wo n't miss it . even the interior design is n't too <unk> , but it definit ha it own charm with it dim light , <unk> green wall , 50 's diner inspir decor piec and so forth . now , onto the rock star of the show : the mini donut . they are extrem afford at $ 2.75 for half a dozen and $ 4 for a dozen ( tax <unk> ) . they tast similar to tini tom donut and , becaus they are freshli made per order , you will get fluffi , soft , and <unk> sweet mouth after a five minut wait . do n't wait too long to bite into them becaus they lose their soft after 15 minut or so . trust me , they are truli at their best when they are eaten fresh from the fryer .
great overal impress . the atmospher is veri invit coupl with friendli servic . you could come here for a casual meal with friend , on a date , or even dress up and have a qualiti meal at an afford price .
i do like the dill . the <unk> soup bread bowl got me through mani a stone afternoon in my <unk> day , and i hope it 's still as good ! onc i drop the vegetarian bull , i start order sandwich here and wa alway delight by the qualiti of the meat and chees and the fresh of the bread . it get incred crowd as one might expect , but that 's okay . it 's total worth it .
my wife and i have been take our car here for a coupl of year now , <unk> honda crv & <unk> toyota <unk> . sinc they are newer car and reliabl <unk> , one would n't expect to have to do ani major repair , which ha been the case . howev , when wait in the lobbi on for our oil chang and such , i 've overheard the tech deal with custom that have major repair and they are veri detail in their explan , and by and larg , they do not seem like <unk> artist at all , which is usual the case with these auto <unk> place , even with just a simpl oil chang they inspect the vehicl thoroughli , even tell thi ladi last time i wa there that her licens plate light wa out ( and it 'd be $ <unk> to fix ) . clean , friendli , thorough place , and they 'll even give you a ride home or to work if the repair take a while .
the signatur <unk> burger definit fit the claim of rich and savori flavor . it take control over everyth els in a meal and deliv exactli what is promis . the bar is not quit as well stock as i would hope and the servic wa nice enough if a bit slow at time . if you find yourself at or near the sl , it 's definit worth tri .
review for dog park ( not board ) : i love thi concept ! it 's too hot to bring my <unk> to outdoor park , but i know he love to play so thi is a perfect and afford solut ! the staff is super nice and they will play and interact with your dog . i realli like that they do behavior assess becaus i 've had too mani <unk> with dog at the tradit dog park that should n't be there . i will probabl continu to take him to the indoor dog park even when it cool down for thi reason . the fact they serv wine and beer is a fun bonu ! they keep the area veri clean , if a dog ha an accid or get <unk> up immedi . there are also grass pad if you 're babi need to use the bathroom .
we were in town on friday and had a larg parti upstair . i have to thank all the staff for be absolut fabul ! ! ! the food wa great as usual and everyth went extrem well ! ! the onli recommend i have is they pop the keg for the pumpkin <unk> that night and it did n't tast the same . it lack it normal pumpkin <unk> flavor . otherwis as alway four peak ha exceed our expect again , thank you ! ! i highli recommend them for dinner , a quick drink by yourself or with friend , or a larg gather .
i <unk> go to thi mcdonald 's becaus of how long the drive-thru take . each time i visit , it never fail and i end up wait 15 minut for a damn drink . do n't stop here if you 're in a hurri .
higher price & smaller shrimp ! we have had mani 5 star meal here but some of the recent chang do n't <unk> well for the futur . recent they rais their menu price 25 to 50 % and cut portion as well the qualiti of some ingredi . pretti <unk> to do both at the same time and i am not sure it will accomplish what they want ; which is to make a profit . i can no longer recommend el <unk> cantina at full menu price , howev some of the discount and promot are still good . now the food ! it is outstand , befor the chang i would have said the best mexican food in la vega . the shrimp <unk> were fabul with the larger shrimp and still good with the smaller one . the shrimp and steak fajita are veri good but they have cut the portion and rais the price from $ 20 to $ 28 ; now you get less steak and 3 small shrimp instead of 4 larg one . i 'm go to go ahead and recommend the follow dish even though i have not tri them sinc they start make chang : cochinita & carnita in taco or the dinner , carn asada , fri <unk> ( sadli now off the menu ) , cilantro garlic shrimp , tropic <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> with pull chicken , <unk> <unk> cake , and the <unk> chile relleno . i love chees enchilada but they realli suck here . do not order them they are not good . the chees is not melt properli , the sauc is ok but there is n't enough of it to make them moist . the shrimp cocktail use to be great but is now way too sweet . not quit the restaur that it wa or could have been but probabl worth a tri with a discount .
thi place is like a pinbal museum with so mani differ pinbal machin , but you can actual play the game here . i am so glad that i final came here . my husband and i came here on a sunday night and it wa n't crowd . i immedi exchang a $ 5 for quarter right when i got there and we play a ton of fun game for 2 hour ( not bad for $ 5 of entertain for 2 ) . the game are from $ <unk> to $ <unk> per play . the older game are $ <unk> and are actual realli amaz to see how they still run and how they work . not onli are there pinbal game , but there are also old school <unk> arcad game here as well and other old <unk> style game . i love that there are <unk> card on most of the game here so you can read a littl bit of the fascin histori over how the pinbal hall of <unk> <unk> the game in their <unk> . some of the stori are pretti interest . some of the game at thi place are just realli cool . i have never play some of these game or seen some of the type of game befor at other arcad or the one arcad that remind me of the place on <unk> 's <unk> ( http : <unk> % <unk> % <unk> % <unk> % <unk> ) . will come back here the next time i am here ( by the way , thi place is pretti close by the strip and is locat in a plaza with a camera shop ) .
just good food . fast and awesom . tri the calzon ! ! ! ! veri good . friendli with fast deliveri
ate here my first night in town for a confer . i had the <unk> tofu burger and it wa amaz . i want anoth one right now . in my belli ! their beer are good as well , i like the mother ipa , though some of the name i felt were <unk> , which cost them a star . for that reason alon , despit the amaz burger , i would consid not return . if you are in the area , check it out .
thi is an excel oyster restaur - it is not a good sushi restaur . if you love oyster , you will be in heaven at thi spot . thi is a must tri spot for oyster . the restaur is nice decor and i found the servic to be pleasant and veri well inform . hope , if you dine here you will have a love of oyster becaus they are fresh , beauti , larg and a veri good deal . i had a mix of the $ 1 and $ 2 oyster with the <unk> cocktail sauc , rosemari <unk> and the ponzu salsa . all the sauc work veri well with the oyster , but the ponzu salsa wa tangi and fresh and it wa the absolut best . to be abl to have a dozen or two of excel oyster and not break the bank is the number one reason to visit thi restaur . i wa veri let down by the nigiri and crudo at thi restaur . we order the nigiri sampler for $ 15 . the fish on the nigiri wa dri out and slice too thin for the price . the rice in the nigiri wa flavorless . so mani other ayc sushi joint in thi town would shame other mama when it come to nigiri . we also tri the <unk> crudo . the flavor of the salsa on the crudo wa amaz , but onc again the tini and thin slice of fish were not accept for the price ( $ 13 ) . i wa n't terribl impress by the cocktail , and i tri two of them . they were small and the fascin descript of the ingredi just did n't deliv a satisfi drink . they do have an excel draft beer select and i found that tast better with the oyster . the next time i go i am just go to order oyster and beer and it will be a 5 star experi . i recommend everyon els do the same .
qualiti danc train with individu and one on one attent . divers staff are profession and friendli . safe environ with welcom student . my daughter could n't be happier !

super famili friendli and such a great staff ! ! my famili come in for taco tuesday often . custom chees dip are excel !
i love the unlimit brow packag and that is the main reason i still come becaus i use the pass constantli . thi use to be my go to locat , howev , i 'm tire of the <unk> <unk> . not onc in the time i 've been there have i purchas the pass for arm and i 'm alway <unk> with it . i understand the `` save '' but i feel like i 'm at the movi theater again with them constantli ask about product and packag and secur book date . i 'll probabl continu to stick with the gilbert store which is a shame becaus i live next to thi locat .

not bad but not worth the price . i had jambalaya , which the server gush about , but it wa made with soggi <unk> instead of rice which , be asian , seem just <unk> to me . my husband had the roast chicken , which wa just okay , and he wa <unk> about have to order asparagu on the side . someon els at the tabl order a duck dish that had a nice , round flavor to it . my cocktail wa kind of gross -- some <unk> with big <unk> of ginger chunk in it . i like ginger but i do n't like it that much , kid . the best thing about the meal were the appet . i rememb the crispi shrimp toast one which wa delici . if i had to come here again ( not by choic , probabl ) , i would like to just get a bunch of appet to share . thi restaur made me feel rip off . one goe to la vega to feel <unk> , not rip off . oh well .

the ambianc of thi restaur is great . you will love the calm surround . the sushi is top of the line tasti and made veri well . the 3 star rate is due to the price . 2 roll of sushi and 2 miso soup for $ 70 . i know it 's vega but in my opinion that 's way too much . if you have the extra cash , go with my bless . otherwis , hold your wallet for anoth sushi place . you can get similar qualiti for half the price elsewher .

snow ice is good . hot tea is not good and i think they are over price . do n't get the hot green tea ! ! ! not good at all . peppermint green tea is the worst ! <unk> . sorri but did not like it ... .
horribl custom servic from <unk> . no greet , no respons to ani question i ask . at first i thought she wa be intent rude , but now i think she wa simpli mental not present at all , so did n't bother to <unk> a respons to ani of my question . half of the yogurt flavor were out of order and the one they had were just ok. would n't come back here again .
as far as bbq goe , thi place is pretti good . had to tri thee <unk> again after drive by and see thi place all <unk> up like a 60 's dinner . when you walk in you know your in good hand after see all of the <unk> they have won over the year . we start with their fri chees squar and fri pickl . both were veri good . my friend had never had a fri pickl so it wa truli a treat for him . i had a pull pork sandwich with the slaw on top . it wa veri good , pork wa tender and dri out . their fri were ok. my friend had their rib which to our surpris had a lot of fat on them . if they smoke their rib for hour you would think there would be littl fat if ani left in them provid they were trim befor cook . we told our server and she state `` no one ever complain about our rib '' ... base on their pull pork and app we will visit them again but we wo n't get rib . mayb tri their brisket instead .
wa look forward to tri thi place out but left disappoint . i did the hot stone bowl for $ 12 which wa dine in onli . it 's <unk> cent extra if you want a fri egg ad . normal , i eat bibimbap where they crack the raw egg and mix it but here it 's alreadi fri . you pick out the ingredi which i thought wa a cool concept and then they have someon warm it up for you . the bowl wa probabl medium size . smaller size than the tradit bibimbap bowl . my food came out and it wa averag . i would say i wish there wa more flavor or someth to bring it more togeth . i think it 's a bit pricey for the stone bowl becaus i can go to a tradit korean place and get it for $ <unk> where they do n't charg you extra for an egg . i will say that my experi wa <unk> . i like the concept but the flavor and tast wa lack for me . i rather go to a korean restaur and order bibimbap becaus it tast better for me . at least i got to experi it .
it 's not easi find good gluten-fre dine in phoenix . sinc the close of <unk> ( about a week after i discov it , <unk> ) i 'd come to the conclus that i 'd just have to deal with the few <unk> chain restaur with their limit option . then , i found <unk> 4 . not onli do i love the food - tri the <unk> <unk> dip - but the ambienc is casual and relax . perfect for a long weekend lunch . i love their select of hot and cold soup , and they even offer gluten-fre bread ( local bake at gluten-fre creation ) . they are a bit on the prici side for what amount to soup , salad , and sandwich , even if you 're not order gluten free , but know exactli what 's in the food i 'm eat is import to me and well worth the extra few buck .
i 've been use mint for 3 year now , never a bad servic . price are good and they usual get out within a coupl day . highli recommend ! !
the food and servic is great here . the food is reason price for what it is . i recommend the chicken pita ! the restaur is pretti well maintain . my onli complaint is that that bathroom are n't veri clean and smell realli bad .

first , let me say that i am a huge fan of dr. andrew <unk> . he is an advoc of eat whole , natur and organ food whenev possibl . he doe n't have a <unk> ' book , but he doe advoc for eat in a way that our bodi our truli <unk> . i wa soo excit to find out about true food kitchen . i found the decor to be light and festiv . my dad found the color remind him of the 70 's . lol . our waiter wa realli nice and took the time to explain all of the tea avail to my mom . he suggest we tri the hummu , and sinc i 'm a sucker for <unk> , we order it . i 'm total go to start make my hummu with some <unk> ! it wa great , but a tad spici for some . we love it . i had the steak taco with <unk> bean . the bean were quit spici and i onli ate half , but they were delici . the taco were great and i could tell the meat wa `` organ '' ( <unk> , of cours meat is organ peopl ! ) becaus of the <unk> tast of meat not rais with ad <unk> . one plu about thi place is that peopl who have allergi to certain food product are absolut abl to eat here . there are plenti of vegan , vegetarian , and <unk> item on the menu . i will definit be back . my onli problem is that i found it to be a bit expens , but then again , i 'm cheap . lol . plu : i saw some dog seat with owner at their side patio tabl !
awesom ! is all i can say . <unk> the owner is super sweet . clean ! smoke free ! the staff is super friendli . i know love pool and i wa n't a fan befor becaus of the <unk> <unk> .
do not go here if you actual need <unk> medic care or even medic care at all ! they do not do a kind of triag of patient , you can wait in line for hour near death behind someon who is in for a routin blood draw . staff ( long brown hair girl at front desk ) is rude and not the most educ , pretti sure she did n't know what triag meant when i ask . stood with our ball 4 year old who wa burn up and no one care !
ate here dure the three angri <unk> st. <unk> 's day celebr . i can not believ how good their burger are . serious . first of all , they are beauti . so pretti , you almost do n't want to eat it . their classic cheeseburg is top with cheddar , fri onion straw , <unk> lettuc , and a fresh tomato . the bun are a <unk> brioch , and tast freshli bake . their fri were good too . the servic wa super friendli and fast . i hope i run into thi truck again . thi is , so far , my favorit burger in <unk> and that 's say a lot with all the great burger we have in thi citi !
well , the call the cab is pretti good . but that may be all . we had the <unk> chip but it wa just <unk> w/ chees . the pizza wa a sad excus for pizza <unk> . had to remind the <unk> about the fact that bathroom need toilet paper on a saturday night . quit a disappoint . well i will tri anoth time to see if they improv .
alaska wa my prefer carrier on the west coast until i decid to make the jump to loyalti program for a much larger network . i alway have like alaska 's level of servic , howev , and if i 'm fli somewher that 's more conveni for alaska 's <unk> , then it 's my top pick . for <unk> - my normal carrier requir a <unk> journey , which is stupid . so alaska is my go-to . they have multipl <unk> flight per day , and at least some of the plane have been updat with the new power outlet at everi seat . and of cours <unk> in <unk> wifi . while airlin servic across the board is a <unk> shadow of what it use to be , as far as the current standard go , alaska still win in my book ... unless you put it up against <unk> , which ha pretti <unk> servic too . that said , the folk who work these flight are nice and friendli . as much as the seat size and <unk> <unk> make it feel like <unk> call in <unk> , the crew on the ground and in the air do n't <unk> to it at all . and when fli to and from la , where it seem the major of peopl do n't listen or ca n't understand basic <unk> , they offer a firm display of remind that i wish all gate agent would . like turn peopl away from board when they 're tri to board ahead of their group . or not let peopl with roller on in the group that 's suppos to be board without roller . my one main gripe with board is that they do offer earlier board to peopl who onli have bag that will fit under the seat . guess what ? those peopl still mostli put those bag in <unk> . frankli if they offer <unk> where i could get my bag at the gate on the other end , i 'd be happi to send my roller below . but otherwis it 's all out <unk> for those <unk> . asid from my main issu with their board process , i dig the rest of the way they do thing at alaska . and i 'll keep dig it ... especi on thi <unk> .
the fusion menu between <unk> 's not here and the red tomato is one of the best <unk> i had so far . the waiter inform us their <unk> menu is extend until februari 12 , <unk> . our famou bake lobster & crab soup truli live up to it reput . the flavour of the seafood wa well blend into thi creami soup and the amount of black pepper they 've put in realli kick a notch . for the main cours , i 've order the grill california cut new york strip steak with rigatoni marinara . the steak wa a bit chewi even though i 've ask for medium rare . as for the pasta , i wa speechless . i 've never tast anyth thi amaz . as for dessert , mango & berri cheesecak wa noth special .
the out decor made us think it 's a fanci french restaur . the indoor wa just normal restaur . the food were okay . my crispi seafood noodl wa good , pad thai wa okay .
i have been go here for year . in my opinion they are the best dri cleaner . it is a famili own busi with a husband and wife run the store . they hang the cloth on <unk> with such love and care . they make our cloth so fresh , new and crisp look . they are a littl expens , but i believ in you get what you pay for . i have been to other dri clean store where it look like they did n't even clean the cloth and they just threw them on the <unk> . best dri cleaner make my cloth look brand new . the wife even doe taylor , i have brought in my dress to get <unk> and she doe a fabul job , i recommend thi place to everyon .
i come here often for lunch becaus i work close by . they have a good lunch special with limit choic for a decent price ... ( like $ 7 ) . i love pad thai so i rare get anyth els . most my cowork like the red or green curri . the servic is good but they can be slow at time ( believ there are onli 2 server ) . overal i come here regularli and will continu to come .
i realli like the <unk> . it feel like such an adult place , quit differ from it <unk> day as <unk> hous of north toronto of the <unk> . the interior is comfort and classi , with a love fireplac in the winter . the bar is cozi as well , and the bar is well stock with singl malt and higher end liquor . you can watch as they shuck oyster at the bar , perhap even onto a plate for you . the patio is one of the better one i 've ever been on . it doe n't look like much from the street , but it <unk> down sever level , as the <unk> is basic a <unk> build with multipl floor lead to the park lot . the patio feel less like a bar patio and more like a deck in a <unk> friend 's backyard . the light could be better -- some corner are nearli complet dark -- but perhap that 's what some patron are look for . i have n't tri much of the food ( i mainli go for cocktail ) , but what food i 've tri ha been tasti , though not inexpens . the servic ha mainli been good , but <unk> on the patio where it can take longer to get a drink and you might have to ask more than onc for water . i 've notic that the clientel is higher end as well . mani <unk> and <unk> in the park lot , and lot of white teeth and <unk> tie around the shoulder insid . i wa there with some friend on a saturday night watch the game and sever singl women of slightli older vintag line the bar . they ad to what is a fun environ , without <unk> of <unk> kid look to get bomb . a comfort place , if a littl off the <unk> path in the heart of <unk> <unk> .
veri low key burrito . they are pretti stingi on the top . plu bathroom did n't have soap to wash hand in . realli realli stingi . i order the veggi burrito , the chees and top were so littl that all i wa abl to tast wa the tortilla ... disappoint becaus i know i have had better burrito .
the <unk> is by far one of the best hotel my famili and i have stay at . the pictur of their room that they advertis onlin is accur . everyth about our room wa clean and that 's what i love most about stay at ani hotel ! all of the staff member were veri kind . keep in mind that thi is n't your fanci mgm , wynn , caesar palac , palazzo type of lobbi . thi hotel is more of a <unk> hotel . they have a swim pool that 's open from <unk> but it 's not big . keep your room key on you at all time becaus for <unk> safeti purpos , you 'll need it in order to get to your floor and for access to the pool and gym . the walk distanc from the strip is <unk> 10-15 minut ! we stay in room <unk> , and it did n't have an amaz view but we could still see some view of the strip . they have free self park and free wifi . we went to la vega in the first week of juli and the temperatur <unk> from <unk> . the air condition work so that 'll be great dure the summer ! they offer aaa discount if you are a aaa member .
i stay at thi hotel for busi last night and i wa impress . first , the good : 1 . pillow : normal , i 'm <unk> of <unk> pillow becaus i 've had so mani that were so flat and <unk> , that i usual bring my own , but the one i had in my room were <unk> , but still had some good support left in them and i <unk> a solid 5 hour . 2 . the bed : a littl on the soft side for my prefer , but still veri support and did n't requir me to wake up and make a signific effort to roll over in the middl of the night . 3 . the room : i had a king room just for myself and it wa veri spaciou . it includ a desk with a nice offic chair , a larg tv whose <unk> could be adjust to view from the bed or from the chair with foot rest easili . there were plenti of <unk> to charg my cell phone from and the <unk> radio actual had an accur time on it . 4 . the amen : i had a fridg , a coffe maker , and a safe in my room . i appreci have the first 2 becaus i brought my own food for dinner and breakfast so i need to keep it cold and i like have coffe in the morn . the safe i could have done without . i had 4 packag of coffe ( 3 <unk> and 1 <unk> ) , sever styrofoam cup , and variou <unk> or shampoo . there wa also an iron and iron board in my room , which is a plu for busi travel . 5 . the door : i like that if i push it back far enough it stay open and did not slam shut on me or my <unk> as i tri to enter my room for the first time . 6 . a balconi : i did n't use it , but it wa nice to know it as there . thing i did n't like : 1 . no breakfast <unk> in the <unk> restaur . there 's noth els around there and the <unk> restaur is <unk> and not healthi for those tri to watch they eat . fortun , i had brought my own food for both meal i wa at the hotel . 2 . the <unk> to the airport : i 'm glad the airport close it <unk> at night becaus i heard plane take off <unk> second up until 10pm and they were so close , i could tell what kind of airlin they were just from the light on the plane , otherwis , no nois over night or it wa veri <unk> . 3 . lack of an elev : now , the hotel onli ha 2 floor , but if you 're a hotel near the airport , it would be safe to assum that mani of your clientel would be travel with a larg , heavi <unk> in tow and have to <unk> it up a flight of steep stair is not veri practic or conveni . overal , i would recommend thi place for busi or if you need a veri conveni place to stay in phoenix befor a morn flight out of ski harbor airport .
good pizza at a great price . not the best pizza i 've had but budget friendli and quick deliveri . the white pizza is my favorit with the 4 differ chees , bacon and tomato . total uniqu and tasti !
i wa beyond satisfi with my visit to <unk> auto . i show up middl of the day with no appoint . i told them i did n't know what the heck wa wrong but i wa hope to at least have someon take a look at my car to let me know what need to be repair and get an estim . they said give them about an hour and they would call with their find . they call within 45 minut to let me know what need to be done . to my surpris they said they were even abl to get all the work done same day . my favorit part of the whole experi is it did n't feel like they were tri to <unk> me . they kept me updat through the whole process and inform me of my option , but did n't pressur me one way or the other . to top it off , the owner <unk> doubl check all the work befor send us on our way . overal , best experi i 've had at an auto shop . i <unk> my car in at about <unk> and it wa back to me by <unk> . thi includ them need two part deliv and the fact that they squeez me into their full schedul . i will be go to them for ani futur need !

i wa <unk> in pittsburgh for a few hour , actual <unk> , long stori . i want a place to eat that wa moder price , and i wa crave a sub or hoagi . i opt for the veggi hoagi san chees . it wa averag , i like that it wa serv on garlic bread and the italian dress wa great . perfectli toast . i feel like it wa a bit pricey for a ten inch veggi hoagi and a soda at <unk> but it wa late and i wa hungri . it 's a small joint , not the nicest decor , but it 's just your averag typic pizza place . doubt i 'll be back .
thi is my go-to meal for a quick lunch or dinner option ! it 's flavor , fresh , and fill ! i love the sandwich size , their pickl , the free kid fire hat , and their <unk> <unk> . it 's a littl pricey compar to their competit , but i 'll pay more for qualiti and conveni . all that 's miss is a <unk> tie to a fire <unk> outsid their front door .
i love love love <unk> 's concept on their cereal soft serv . the place is so clean and the staff are extrem friendli . they are current do their grand open special , and despit how busi they are , they take the time to explain to custom what they have to offer . i had their strawberri cheesecak . it came with nice and crunchi cereal , fresh chop strawberri , and high qualiti soft serv ! thi ha me crave for more ! ! ! ! i also had their rose milk and it wa a good amount of sweet and absolut too beauti to drink . highli recommend to everyon ! ! !

thi place is great . food is fantast . salsa are all homemad fresh everyday . the need a better way to order though . their system is realli confus and peopl get mad becaus of the confus . they still get 5 star becaus it super good food . the price is a littl high too , but the food is worth it ! they should drop the price by 1 dollar per item and it would be in the right spot . all around a realli great place . cute girl work here too .
<unk> , it wa alright . i 'm sure it 'd be better if i actual went there <unk> get it deliv . it did n't live up to my ny pizza expect .

i visit <unk> for their soft open today for dinner . me and two friend got there around <unk> and had to wait until <unk> for a tabl . we order a <unk> to share and then each got the <unk> black ramen ( a name <unk> taken from <unk> <unk> -- black , mayb ? ) at some point , the woman in charg gave us free edamam to apolog for the wait , which wa realli nice of her . also , she regularli check in to make sure we were well serv . from there , we then wait anoth two hour for our ramen . the food wa realli tasti and worth the price but the wait wa too long . i know that a friend of mine who wait a similar amount of time got some sort of <unk> off of hi meal but thi option wa n't avail for me and my friend , which wa disappoint . if i have a good experi at thi place next time in term of wait or if they offer us the same discount to accommod our super long wait time , i 'll probabl updat my review to be 5 star . pro : <unk> food , the broth is authent and tasti <unk> size portion <unk> noodl ( not authent but they 're still tasti ) -realli good <unk> ( it 's serv with <unk> spici mayo but could realli use a lemon . also , there were a lot of fri dough piec that did n't have ani meat . i 'd recommend get <unk> of these becaus they 're just kinda oili and <unk> from an otherwis realli good appet . ) <unk> varieti insid the ramen <unk> price <unk> decor insid , i realli like the expos kitchen area ( super authent look ! ) -realli nice servic ( the ladi help us felt bad for the wait and gave us free edamam ) -the staff were realli attent and refil our water regularli -the menu select seem realli nice -realli good for a soft open <unk> <unk> box are super <unk> and given the number of time i 've had those soup contain <unk> on me , i can realli appreci that . <unk> qualiti meat con : <unk> long wait ( we kept be told that our order wa come but we consist saw tabl seat after us get serv first , thi is whi i took away one star for thi place . ) -the seat area where you wait to be call up is kind of small and you basic had to wait outsid or next door at <unk> . -the soft boil egg wa a littl overcook -the spoon given with the ramen wa a littl dirti , kinda wish i said someth about it but i did n't want to bother the waitress . i would recommend get a new one if thi happen to you . it 's probabl just a dishwash mishap . -the tabl were a bit too close togeth in my opinion but thi realli wa n't a big deal . all in all , i 'm realli happi with the food here even though there wa a long wait . i ca n't wait for them to get into the swing of thing becaus thi place ha a lot of potenti and i 'm happi to see a good ramen place other than <unk> on green !
i purchas over $ <unk> in applianc , all from spencer 's . the upfront servic wa veri good , particularli the sale person . the `` after the sale '' custom servic wa pathet . i purchas 4 <unk> product includ washer and dryer , <unk> and dishwash , all the upgrad model . the refriger is tip back and uneven on the floor . when you open it , the shelv are tip to the back and it is clear that there is a problem . neither spencer 's or <unk> would do anyth , even after the contractor sent pictur of the tip refriger . my definit of good custom servic is what happen after the sale and both of these compani fail . it is veri frustrat , especi sinc thi wa a huge invest for my husband and <unk> i would not recommend either busi especi in light of the poor `` after the sale '' support .

we came here with 13 peopl around <unk> pm . it 's kinda dumb they do n't let you order a bottl of liquor at anytim . they told us it 's onli cocktail when we came in . they lost busi sinc we onli grab a few cocktail and left . plu , they 're super disorgan here . it took forev just to order ... then get our drink ... then tri to close out . it 's ridicul .
my daughter went here for the first year and a half of her life . she had special need and i do not feel like they protect her enough . she did not walk until she wa almost 2 and did not sit up on her own until after her 1st birthday . basic all she did wa lay on the carpet area or do the <unk> crawl . unfortun , kid would pull her hair and hurt her even though she wa essenti <unk> .
it 's just okay . the fit area is realli small and lack proper gym equip . mostli just <unk> gear .
everyon one in there is veri help and friendli . they exceed my expect and would recommend them to who ever need their servic .
the <unk> is amaz the staff is so friendli & <unk> <unk> and rachel are the best . their food blow ani place in henderson out of the water ! definit recommend the street benni & <unk> <unk> !
good food , okay atmospher . order takeout for two , had a local beer at the bar while i wait . ha an older crowd feel . bar look outdat and a littl messi .
veri cool place . nice vibe and great coffe . i got one of the blend drink . thi cafe is awesom becaus it 's open 24/7 and you can sit there and studi or do work . i had to log in to work and it wa perfect .
appet in the bar were great . went back the next week for a meal , and wa n't as impress with the dinner . restaur wa loud , servic a littl slow on a friday . i never did get ani salt , which wa need for the chip and salsa ! i thought i would give 4 star after the <unk> and <unk> <unk> but the rest did n't live up to the hype .
veri unprofession . after give the front staff my insur inform one of the girl told me my insur did n't cover alopecia . keep in mind thi is my first time come here and they 're get their inform from what i thought wa <unk> patient inform . i did <unk> hair <unk> , to <unk> my symptom on paper . the front desk attend diagnos me with alopecia while i 'm still in the wait room with multipl patient who could hear our convers . they told me my offic visit would be $ 160 . at thi point i 'm embarrass . `` well is there anyth els you have , becaus hair <unk> just wo n't be cover '' i said no it 's a littl differ i do n't know if it 's alopecia . front desk 's repli wa `` well there 's differ type .

anoth day and anoth review of a taco place . these place are pop up like weed and i keep eat . good food here . 3 taco combo came with taco , rice and bean , and a drink for about 10 buck . taco were a littl small , wa go to order a 4th after i ate but could n't find the cashier . chip were good , crispi , warm . good salsa . they were out of guacamol . i had the carn asada , fish , and green chili chicken . fish wa the best i order . the chicken wa a littl bland . carn asada wa what i expect . tri the carnita and that wa my favorit . when i 'm in the area and in the mood for taco i will be back .
in fair i would give <unk> 3 1/2 star but wa unabl to do that . the fare is not terribl creativ but it is an oasi in the <unk> airport area where there are so few decent choic and mani restaur which are just aw . the sushi is alway fresh and tasti and the servic is friendli . i have usual opt for combin platter sinc they are quick and easi at lunch . i also recommend the gyoza ( basic japanes <unk> ) which are alway flavor and properli cook . enjoy !
grant it wa busi just after <unk> on a thursday , i didnt think it wa so <unk> to <unk> such a long wait , <unk> 20 minut to get our <unk> we did get it , half the meal wa warm , the other cold . good review so we went , i 'm five them the benefit of doubt with a 3 . <unk> staff wa excel , constantli stop by to see if there wa anyth we need while we wait for the food .
i had the lunch special <unk> while travel through temp . it wa too salti . not pleasant . the ambianc wa veri noisi . the servic wa slow . i would not go back .

we were there for the first time tonight . there were three of us who veri clearli order gin and soda water . all three of us order separ and said the same exact thing . gin and soda water . we were given three gin and tonic . my husband who is a type one <unk> ca n't realli drink that . the bartend gave us a <unk> stori about how he would have to pay for the drink if he mess up , so we ( in veri poor <unk> ) agre to pay for an extra drink to switch a tonic out for soda water . then we ask for a glass of water and he gave us a bottl which we were charg for . i also ask what their vibe wa and the bartend ( who had been there for year ) had absolut no idea . it had a cool atmospher , but they are lost as to who they are and are serious just tri to rip you off . i would definit avoid go here .
the pharmaci is 24 hour and gener alway busi . i have n't had the best experi there , but whenev i go it look like they 're understaf by at least <unk> peopl . the last time i wa there , the girl behind the counter told me she `` doe n't usual work back here . '' oh ... comfort . unfortun i do have to keep come back becaus it 's so close to my apart . <unk> .
thi place is veri nice for the area of town . the price are reason . they do a hot stone massag which is awesom ! and they use a timer set at 10 min for the pedi which is nice becaus you know you wo n't get short . but they also wo n't go over either which is a <unk> . but all in all i wa happi with the servic i receiv .
how could anyon give thi co-op less than five star ? they are pretti standard in term of vibe and product compar to other co-op throughout the countri , but they have other co-op beat in term of size , prepar food section , seat , and they have some great sale item ! also they honor other co-op membership which is pretti cool consid i am just pass through . i appreci how there 's alway someon out front either play music or tabl for someth . my onli complaint is the park , which is too limit for the amount of busi they do , but street park is n't too hard . i love it here , i 'll take ani excus to stop by !
with the dim light and `` stack '' layer of wood , i feel like i 'm eat insid a <unk> . i love to just sit back and enjoy the atmospher , but the macaroni and chees with truffl put the awesom experi over the edg .
forget the frustrat of walgreen and <unk> . refil pharmaci is the best ! there is never a long wait and they are veri help and friendli . i wo n't go anywher els ! thank you refil pharmaci !
a must eat ! drunk or <unk> ! no sign ... just go find it ... the adventur is half the fun ! the white wa our favorit , but they were all good . i would definit say go in blind and just look for it , do n't ask just go for it !
my cowork want to go for asian food but on the `` <unk> '' end so we gave <unk> a shot . there were five of us and we order a bunch of item to share . 1 ) fri watermelon - we thought thi wa uniqu and want to tri thi . i thought it would tast a lot better consid the price we pay for it . it just tast fri with water ( the watermelon wa n't veri flavour ) 2 ) big mac `` <unk> '' - i saw pictur of thi while i wa yelp about what to eat . the pictur look good so i want to tri thi . the <unk> wa hot and fresh , but wa not flavour . i wa n't a big fan of the sauc <unk> it . 3 ) <unk> slaw - i realli enjoy thi dish . i thought it wa veri flavour and the <unk> wa delici . i think thi wa one of their cheaper and bigger dish . 4 ) crispi octopu taco - thi came with two taco . the octopu tast realli good . 5 ) miso salt cod brandad - i order thi think it wa soup with the chines donut . i realiz that you dip the chines donut in the brandad . the brandad did n't tast good alon . the cod wa veri minim but when i had a bite of it , it wa realli good . at the end , we finish all the chines donut , with a lot of leftov brandad . 6 ) char siu pork loin - i realli enjoy thi dish too . the char siu wa realli <unk> so flavour and juici . i think it came with 3 steam bun but we order an addit one . 7 ) ponzu beef carpaccio - thi dish wa realli good but there wa not a lot of beef . overal , the atmospher wa realli nice . the food are overpr . the portion of the food wa also for snack . it wa a good experi , probabl would not dine here again , as i would rather spend the money on differ restaur .
i have n't been to a lot of <unk> for comparison , but whenev i come here they resolv whatev my need is . new licens , easi . park ticket , paid . forgot my pink slip , go home and get it . big lineup , onli at the end of the month . long wait time , they have a big screen tv . the last few time i 've been here there ha been no <unk> and onli a coupl peopl work at the counter . that wa more than enough . even when it 's busi the staff are pleasant and help . tip , go in the middl of the month .
one of my go to spot for lunch , best hot sandwich in town : there 's a lot of `` sandwich shop '' out there , non come close to <unk> 's . i 've also cater food for parti and corpor event a hand of time . they 've never disappoint , highli recommend thi place

i recent <unk> into town from california to visit famili . i heard thi wa the place to go for breakfast and it did not disappoint ! in fact , <unk> 's appl pancak were the best i 've ever had in my life ! the homemad sauc they use is out of thi world . the atmospher feel like you 're right at home . everyon is so welcom and friendli . ca n't wait to go back for breakfast again . highest recommend !
someon give thi place a michelin star . i went to a new american restaur last night and wa remind of forequart . the restaur wa decent , but i just kept recal how amaz my meal wa at forequart . there are so mani restaur tri to be similar to forequart in seattl , but they are just not success . i just do n't know how forequart can improv . it is that amaz , and it is worth a trip back to wisconsin to <unk> that experi .
they have 30 sauc for their wing and tender . i had the hot bbq and <unk> hot sauc on my boneless wing . it wa delish ! ! ! the servic wa friendli and attent . they have nfl ticket , so it 's a great place to chill on sunday . they even put on the <unk> game outsid for me ! !
i wa so disappoint with the servic at the <unk> locat . i 've been there a coupl time befor , about two year ago , and have never had a problem . i call on monday to schedul an appoint for a new fuel cap and an oil chang . i wa told to come in wednesday at 3 . when i got there , no one greet me and it took over an hour of me wait to get the oil chang without ani one check in with me . when i went to pay , i ask the manger to fill out my form from <unk> state that i got a new fuel cap . he look puzzl and when i ask if they put the cap on he said that i had to `` help him out '' by tell him ahead of time . i state that i ask for that when i call for my appoint . he told me that i had an appoint at two that i show up late for ( my appoint wa at 3 ) and then he told me that i never even had an appoint . that wa interest sinc he took my call on monday . i wa fine with them not do the cap sinc it 's an easi fix , but i 'm not okay with someon tell me that it 's my fault for someth they guy did n't do . i do n't feel that i or ani other custom deserv to be treat in that manner . i 'm sorri to say that i can no longer go back to that shop . i should have trust the yelp other review .
i start go here last month , best servic ever . and price are pretti good . <unk> doe my eyebrow , she 's super friendli and doe an awesom job : ) . there wa onli one time i wait but there wa onli a few peopl in front of me and she wa the onli one work . she did it pretti fast . i recommend thi place ! !

fabul food and <unk> my husband and i sat outsid in the <unk> the servic superb onli disappoint no free <unk> !
the <unk> should plan an <unk> <unk> oper there , becaus whatev <unk> they use for the batter must certainli be illeg in the 50 state and <unk> . that is some <unk> addict tasti chicken they serv there . the insid is juici and tender due most like to a phenomen <unk> method , but the fri batter is what stand out . surprisingli still light and not overli greasi . the side sauc option is good , but in my person opinion not what make cane 's an outstand fast food option . as for the rest of the side on the menu : greasi carb , fri carb and fatti green ( toast texa toast , french fri and coleslaw ) . i usual skip the side in fear of turn to carb myself . it is just too much of it . if you go for a side , the toast are good but mayb too greasi when alreadi eat fri chicken . fri are actual not too bad , but cane 's will never win `` best fri '' award . cole slaw is better than kfc ( i know . whi make a comparison to someth not worth it ) . as for servic , the staff is alway veri courteou , friendli and thorough ( even though in the past they forgot 1 of my chicken finger on a drive-thru run ) . note to ani <unk> agenc <unk> an <unk> into the good of those finger : i 'll be happi to watch over the <unk> evid . it 'll be perfectli safe .
jeff and jason alway take great care of me . i have use them for <unk> stuff , <unk> , auto start , dvd <unk> , and i 've refer sever friend . never disappoint . my <unk> sound great . my wife 's <unk> alway keep the kid entertain . we appreci the great custom care and fair price .
alright ! ! about to tri some bbq ! ! the <unk> rib , collar green , green bean and mac & chees wa awesom ... . they give a lot of food ...
i 'm honestli realli realli disappoint . i had the crispi duck over drunken noodl for a <unk> <unk> dollar . the noodl were all stuck togeth , tasteless , and cover in oil from the duck . the duck wa not realli crispi , but just hard and oili from the batter , and had littl meat . the sauc , which is usual the redeem qualiti , wa just bad . note : thi place is alot further than it look . it wa a 10-15 minut taxi ride from the strip becaus of the stop light and such .
we had <unk> set up a photo booth at our wed in <unk> , oh on <unk> . their booth wa an amaz success ! dan and mari were so great to work with . they met up with us about 1.5 month befor the wed to go over the kind of booth that we want . the day befor , total <unk> to us , dan took a separ trip to the recept hall just to make sure that all of the logist were in place for them to set up . dure the wed , there wa a line for their booth the entir night ! they have amaz option for all the photo , from cool prop that peopl can wear to differ background to thing that can be written or place into the photo to make them more fun . you can also give them an <unk> and then peopl will be abl to put their photo into the <unk> as soon as it is taken and can write a messag next to the photo . you are given access to an onlin galleri and <unk> featur all the photo from the entir even . all of thi come at a veri reason price . everi guest that we spoke too had such a great time with the photo booth ! overal , we are so happi that we chose to have <unk> at our wed , and from now on will never use ani other photo booth compani for social occas . thank you so much to dan and mari help make our wed the most amaz day of our live !
best donut i 've had in a long time ! ! ! ! they were super tasti , so fluffi and soft . my daughter love them ! ! and the staff wa super friendli ! !
when i wa pregnant with my first child back in the <unk> , my crave were siomai and mami . that 's when my love <unk> with siomai start and it continu to thi day . besid <unk> garden , chow king is anoth place that satisfi my siomai crave . and they have delici mami with oh so tender beef , i could eat 2 order of . it 's locat insid seafood citi , a place i avoid at all cost . space is small so it 's alway crowd . so , i call ahead and hubbi pick up the food for us or i have it deliv . i use <unk> last time and order our favorit plu decid to tri the <unk> and <unk> . the <unk> i would not order again , bland . the <unk> , fill wa <unk> . both these dish i do not recommend , get the siomai and mami !
thi is the worst starbuck i have ever been to . the last two time i have been here there ha been 2 employe and about 5 peopl in line and 10 wait for drink . it 's realli sad to have such a bad experi multipl time .
came here for a treat while we were in the area . great assort of flavor and veri friendli staff . sinc i work in the area , i plan on make thi a regular spot to grab a sweet treat !
i keep come back for more ! love the place . it could use some more decor but the staff is friendli and prompt the meat is plenti , tender and tasti .
i tell myself i should tri some of their other delici look offer but i find myself order their walnut cake anyway . you ca n't go wrong with 6 cake ( so you can get two of each flavor ) for onli $ 2.75 . the cake is soft and the insid is pack with a good amount of fill . they are not overli sweet so you can finish most of them befor you even notic how addict they are ! ! perfect for a snack or <unk> dessert .
i order food saturday night from <unk> . wait 1 hour and 40 minut to get cold food . i call mark , ( manag ) . he told me he wa off on sunday , but would follow up with me on monday . that did n't happen . he did n't even care until i told him i wa go to put up neg review . anyway , i final receiv a refund . after spend over an hour on the phone with grub <unk> . glad i receiv cold food , and a refund . i will never go back to thi locat .
<unk> is a wonder <unk> . a lot of their book are remaind or <unk> new book , which are price veri , veri nice . the <unk> select wa surprisingli excel . there is also a good select of use book , cover the whole <unk> . the onli <unk> , at least as concern the <unk> <unk> , is that most of the book are <unk> . definit worth a visit .
in town for 2 day and both day had to eat here . excel food and servic wa magnific . can not say enough about bobbi ( <unk> ) make sure to ask for him you 'll be treat like <unk> ! ! !
thi place is aw . not onli is it expens , the food qualiti wa poor . we order the meatbal pho , the chicken curri , and the pork rice . first up for review ... the chicken curri . it wa my mistak to order curri at a pho restaur . the chicken wa dri and the curri itself wa bland . the pork rice wa n't ani better . the rice wa hard and the pork had no flavor . the best out of the 3 dish we order wa the meatbal pho and even that wa n't good . the noodl were all stuck togeth and their meatbal tast like they had just been <unk> from the freezer . the onli thing that wa decent wa their broth . it wa flavor , but that wa it .
me and a friend stop in on a weeknight . i had made reserv , but they were n't need . ( see abov ) i 'm told that it is pretti pack dure lunch . we ate outsid , so i ca n't realli comment on the interior . from what i saw , it ha a sleek modern look . the patio outsid is small but the tabl are well space and you are under an <unk> to help keep the sun directli off of you . which is awesom for those of us who shave their head . ( it 's a <unk> choic , <unk> ) i ask the server what they recommend and got a few good recommend along with the suggest that i had to tri the <unk> peanut stew . who am i to <unk> ? so i got that and their blt while my friend got their veggi big mac . which is exactli what it sound like , a big mac , but total vegetarian . a word befor i go on . the server brought an entir bottl of water for our tabl so we could serv ourselv . for those of you who have had the uniqu pleasur of dine with me , thi wa the 2nd best thing that a server could do . ( the 1st be `` our meal is on the hous '' of cours ) the peanut stew arriv and wa delici . i found myself <unk> the bottom of the bowl wish for more , when i rememb i had order the small version . damn my <unk> calori count . the flavor is heavi on peanut , but mix in curri as well . my friend and i split our sandwich , so i had both the blt and veggi big mac . i love the present of the veggi big mac and thought it wa delici , but overal i thought the blt wa a bit <unk> . the egg and toast bread be the standout for me . servic wa quick and attent , but again as the onli one there , i can not say it is alway like thi . in a complet <unk> for myself , no alcohol wa order so i can not comment . i went back and forth between 4 & 5 star for <unk> vida . but realli , the 4 star would onli have been becaus when i got there at <unk> on a weeknight , the place wa complet desert . that doe n't seem fair , so five star it is . i do have to say to give thi place a tri , <unk> dish , good servic , reason price and a great locat in downtown cleveland .
absolut spectacular servic from start to finish . <unk> help me pick a ring and a stone use my request as a guid . the ring turn out beauti and he even accommod a rather tight deliveri timelin . could not be happier with my choic to work with <unk> and son for my engag ring , and my fiancé is <unk> too !
i had not been to la vega in about 2 year and book a mini vacat onlin for a 4 night stay at <unk> island , my check in wa fast a simpl and girl at the desk had a great smile and made me fell real welcom . i wa in my room within 10 minut . hotel is in the middl of the strip walk distanc to most other major hotel and show , they have a great <unk> show the in the front of the hotel call the <unk> of <unk> . room rate rang from $ 45 and up you can get a better deal if you shop onlin . the room i had had 1 king size bed a larg bathtub cabl tv is free with the room , i had a flat <unk> tv in my room , room have a mini refriger and a safe to lock you person item in , you can <unk> a smoke or non smoke room . there is a starbuck locat on the casino level . i ate at there buffet good food good price . the onli bad is they charg for wifi like $ <unk> for onli a <unk> period and sinc most of use carri laptop or <unk> with built in wifi and not <unk> thi should be free . that be said . i will stay there again great time..
i like the <unk> but i 'm not into pay way too much for food at the farmer market . i wo n't be shop here again anytim soon .
best servic and food in the area ! love their breakfast menu ! ! ! i love their bagel sandwich and <unk> . if you 're in the area , i highli recommend thi place to anyon who like good qualiti food at an afford price .
thi place ha a wide select of product and had everyth i need , except the custom servic i had gone in expect base on other review . i wa greet as soon as i walk in and thought that i wa about to get some great servic , but sadli i wa wrong . i felt like i wa treat as if i wa stupid becaus i did n't know everi singl detail about the juic they had on hand . i told them i normal vape 100 % <unk> juic ( velvet cloud vapor ) and like custard flavor and want to see if they had anyth similar . the respons i got wa `` there are no 100 % <unk> juic . '' and that wa it . i then stood there for at least a minut in <unk> until they final spoke up & recommend a flavor . mayb it 's not a big deal for other peopl , but amaz custom servic and help a custom in need is someth i 'd expect from a decent busi . instead , i felt like the odd guy out and like i wa dumb & did n't belong there . check out went pretti well , but at that point all i care about wa pay and leav . sadli , despit have great product , i 'm not sure i will return to here .
i went the other day for lunch and the place is pretti good ( realli 4.5 star ) . i got the cornbread enchilada , a uniqu concept in and of itself , with the red sauc . the red sauc had a veri <unk> heat that did n't overpow the flavor and mesh well with the slightli sweet cornbread . i will definit be back to tri some of the other menu item and support a local busi that is <unk> out excel food at reason price .
it 's been four year sinc my last review of prime . i 'm <unk> to say that it ha lost a star . i said it wa a classi restaur in my last review . it ha lost some of it class . it use to be a quiet , intim atmospher . it now ha a hectic feel to it . the background nois is terribl . but to the dinner . we love the chill seafood platter . it is still good but the crab leg were soggi and size of the platter ha decreas by a third , with an increas in price . my wife had the <unk> lobster . it wa cook perfectli and wa delici . i had the dri age bone in ribey . i alway order it <unk> . it arriv undercook . i did not send it back but probabl should have . the side have alway been excel . we split the steam asparagu and mash potato . still excel . prime is still one of our favorit and i 'm sure we 'll be back . it 's just sad to see an old friend declin in qualiti .
we decid to eat here after we ate dinner at woo 's and left hungri . thi place is veri reason price and the staff wa veri friendli . open 24 hour and perfect if you are stay in the palazzo hotel . we also order food to go and brought up to our hotel room . the guy that help us made sure we had everyth we need so we would n't have to come back down from the room .
i rare complain . thi place need better manag and better train employe . if someon take your order , begin the crepe and finish cook it ... they should complet the order instead of leav the crepe to get cold while you go to the regist to take other order . that 's not how you work an order . 5-10 minut later the employe goe back to finish the crepe ... and then load it up with whip creme when i specif said no whip creme . now i have to wait anoth 10 minut for a new one ? no thank . ask for my money back and left . never again . poorli run and for how much they charg they need to have experienc employe ... at the veri least .
i 've use these guy and they do good work , howev the first time i use them , they pull a <unk> and switch on price , claim i wa n't clear on the <unk> of work . we talk it out , came up with a fair cash price , etc . i schedul them for addit work ... so today i prep my area for work , bring in some addit block for patch , take time off work , etc . it been rain for day here in town and the concret need protect from over spray of the blast , and he wo n't do it becaus the tape wo n't stick , which is fine . but instead of come back when i <unk> him not protect my new concret , he call me a nasti name in spanish and walk off the job , ignor my question of whether he wa come back when everyth dri out . when i text he simpli said find someon els . what a class act ! avoid these guy , despit their work .
thi is my second review ( first be their locat in the southwest ) and i 'm a happi camper ! realli <unk> that they have one a bit closer to where i 'm live now . as a huge plu , everyth is vegan and delici . the onli neg is that i probabl cant eat one everi <unk> but i would if i could ! everyth is so fresh here and alway exactli how you want it . they even let you sampl the frost first to see if it 's go to work perfectli with your <unk> . 5 star all day babi .
have you ever experienc that feel when you 're so <unk> content with your exist that you just want to kill yourself out of <unk> joy ? like , you 've fill the void in your <unk> and know that your time on earth is complet ? like when you 're super old and have had a long , lush , <unk> life and you 're just readi to die ? basic , do n't sit near the window if you 're eat upstair . brian will lead you into the light with the <unk> special . and do n't order someth wrong unless you 're sure you have no import appoint schedul . group <unk> <unk> are held after dinner servic on the roof of the el <unk> park structur . see you there .
sushi <unk> onli . the chines buffet is decent , about the same as ever other chines buffet in the world ... ... ... my review is base on go to visit toni the sushi dude for the past eight year . although , i know live an hour away , i make the trek to visit with him . he ha a new guy who is just as <unk> to make you the perfect roll , hi name is <unk> ... ... these are two realli good and person guy . he ha a second joint that is now on my <unk> , <unk> asian bistro ... .. it is in fort mill . : - ( now i just need an excus to go to fort mill ... ... ..
i have no complaint about the buffet . it wa $ 18 for adult , $ 12 for kid under 12 , and my 2 year old wa free . we came around <unk> ( they were close down breakfast at <unk> , but they were ad lunch item to the menu which wa a good look sinc now we had more a varieti dure their rotat ( im not much of a breakfast food person anyway ) . i did have a bagel <unk> <unk> ( which wa yummi , and their chees grit were not bad either ) . for lunch menu item , i had their sushi , and their mac n chees wa to die for ( have you ever eaten or seen mac n chees at a buffet ? ? it normal look hideou ) . their prime rib wa moist , but <unk> clear from their taco bar becaus although the <unk> wa delici their meat look like `` <unk> meat '' . fresh veggi , sushi , etc ... the onli downfal wa that it took a while for a waitstaff to clear our plate from the tabl . if you are in a larg parti , be prepar to wait a lot longer ( and pay a littl more ) than parti of 4 or less .
great mussel , beer , and bison burger . would definit go back . ye , servic could be better . but veri good food and drink at a veri reason price .
@ <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> # <unk> you can access thi trail via a lot of point - it 's actual the first regist section of the <unk> canada trail . we access it through a <unk> yet charm town of <unk> , right off of <unk> road . to those stay in mississauga and <unk> , you can basic take the road straight down to the trail . appar , it is n't a hidden secret and ton of peopl know about thi trail . we went at 7 am and saw a few <unk> and some walker . we hike down with caesar ( my <unk> ) and it wa seren and empti enough that i could let him off <unk> . we cover about <unk> ( past <unk> 10 and then back ) . it 's an easi hike as the land is pretti flat , a few up and down here and there but noth too rough . it wa mostli pebbl path with tree on both side and some stream of water that caesar wa so <unk> on jump into . there were 2 concret bridg we cross over - all in all it wa a great morn walk with the dog . i highli recommend thi place .
i do n't whi thi hotel is rate high . it 's a pathet restaur . actual i am right now in the restaur . they have a buffet lunch . onc i took the curri i wa told i will get the naan but i had to wait <unk> until i went and ask for it again . atmospher suck . i would better have gone to some ga station and got <unk> .
everi time we come to vega we say we will visit gold & silver pawn shop but we never have the time . thi time my husband wa not leav without stop by thi place ! ! so we were on a mission ! ! ! first of all , good luck find park ! ! we must 've made 4 <unk> befor we could find someth within walk distanc ( and you definit want to be within walk distanc in that area ) ! ! when we final got there , there wa quit a line which made me want to leav but like i said we were on a mission ! luckili the line move veri quickli , 10 minut at the most . onc insid the place is not quit how it look on tv but that 's the magic of <unk> , right ? it 's small & full of `` <unk> '' , my husband realli want to look at the guitar but there wa onli about 4 , not a big select . to me it 's exactli what i expect from a pawn shop , which is n't much ! ! all in all i 'm glad i saw it so i do n't have to have the urg to see it anymor but my husband wa pretti disappoint ! oh and there were no familiar face insid , but i realli did n't expect them to be ... . come on they are rich now ! ! they do n't need to work at a pawn shop ! !

i wa replac a <unk> <unk> that i bought brand new and love , and we had to have a car we could tow behind our <unk> like we did the <unk> . we were look for a use honda crv , <unk> or older with low mileag , leather seat and prefer a light color . we found one i thought i like , but drove it and did n't realli like the seat comfort as much as i would have hope . the first and second trip i did n't realli consid ani other . i look at a few , but not serious . then the more i thought about it , i decid that would be a good car . when we went back two day later , it wa gone . the gentleman who help us the next time wa rich <unk> . he got the key to all the crv and we look and sat in everi one . rich wa veri patient and kept the process easi , not pushi , but wa there for ani question . he wa a natur fit for us , our person just mesh . i made a decis that day and bought the car and drove it home . easi as that . i did n't even cri when i said <unk> to the old one .
fun experi , bacon <unk> chees wa yummi . carmel <unk> chocol is tasti ! !
came here <unk> thi place is <unk> we like it.. it ha yummi pizza , it 's <unk> , and ha a live <unk> there 's just someth a bit miss with the servic i <unk> you constantli feel rush , the staff bare stand still to take your order and <unk> through appet ( at about $ 15 each ) main are slam down as soon as they 're readi follow by the check mid <unk> everyth is attend to it just seem rush and a bit <unk> my wife made the observ that it wa all male staff , and mayb they need a femal on the team , which we thought wa <unk> otherwis we like it.. great pizza , but it 'd be nice if the guy took 4.5 to just say and act out some basic <unk> etc . at $ 30 per person , i do n't think it 's that crazi to feel a need <unk>
practic empti for a friday night . there is noth much els i can say . i 'll give a singl star for decor .
thi wa my first visit ever to <unk> 's , base on sever recommend from friend and famili . the first thing i notic when arriv wa the appar lack of seat in the wait area . a few more chair or even a comfi sofa would have been appreci . the restaur wa dimli lit , obvious to set the mood . seat wa surprisingli quick , but the wait servic wa surprisingli slow . i wa amaz how long it took for the waiter to come by the tabl just to greet and take drink order . the food wa certainli abov par for most italian restaur in the area . i am a fan of the pasta dish , particularli the rigatoni - <unk> i wa happi to take part in the buy 1 dinner , take one home promot that had start a few day befor my visit . like i said , the speed of servic need to be <unk> up a tad , as the restaur wa not overli crowd . the one thing i wa a littl taken back by , wa the restroom on the second floor . it seem a littl out of the way and slightli inconveni for those folk , like myself , who had never dine there befor . but , the food qualiti and upscal atmospher make up for it quit nice .
the <unk> at thi <unk> were veri , veri help . i wa have starter problem so they test my batteri . i had no idea that my batteri wa eight year old and on it <unk> . they instal a new batteri and had me on my way in a minim amount of time . car can be a pain in the ass , they make it less so . thank guy !
tri it and it wa not good . servic wa horribl and the food wa low qualiti . french onion soup tast like brown salt water , rib eye steak had no flavor . took 45 minut to get the check even after ask at least 3 time . i do not believ it when peopl think thi is a qualiti place .
i went here last thanksgiv week when visit boyfriend 's parent in north scottsdal and it wa memor . i am still dream about that <unk> milkshak with roast marshmallow . my boyfriend 's famili made fun of me while i <unk> the last bit in the <unk> of the car ; they know i am <unk> and not in the habit of drink milkshak , but thi wa so good . i would give it a 5 but the servic is realli slow at night if they 're busi and even still , i sens a gener confus overal . the pizza could have a <unk> crust but it wa excel and all our appet , includ that fig bruschetta , were terrif . the price is veri low to a person from la , <unk> , nyc or other <unk> citi . and the wine is realli cheap ! decent glass ( not happi hour ) for 6 to 7 . i love thi place and ca n't wait to return in 7 week when we go back for thanksgiv
use thi firm at your own risk ! they are not half price . their rate are compar to much better <unk> in town . if you use them be prepar for a cooki <unk> , imperson , jam a squar <unk> into a round hole type of experi . been tri to get an owner , partner , or anyon who care about thi firm 's consum reput to return my call for over a week now . veri poor experi ! in fact , the experi ha been so poor that i will like leav $ 500 in <unk> servic to thi firm on the tabl so i can hire a differ firm that will give my case some person attent . might be good for some <unk> traffic type work but if you have ani import legal matter you would be well serv to look for a more person experi .
upgrad my review to 5 star becaus the food is that good , lol ! came back a second time , thi time for dinner , and order the same set . we were with visitor and want a higher , <unk> impress ' lobster mountain ' so instead of have the lobster cook 4 way , the server suggest we cook it 3 way , perfect ! : d we chose to have the lobster claw cook with ( duck ) yolk and it wa soooo delici ! ! the servic wa as friendli and fast as when we came for lunch . there 's onli 2 seat for dinner so make sure you make a reserv befor come in .
3.5 star . i 've read numer <unk> review about <unk> , but my experi there wa unfortun disappoint . at some point i 'll give it one more tri with hope that last saturday wa an `` <unk> , '' but it wo n't be anytim soon . i 'm sure mani of you <unk> <unk> lover are <unk> right now , but thi wa genuin a 3.5 star experi . our server wa polit but overli rush all night , which eventu becam uncomfort . i began with a `` <unk> 's ripper 12 '' cocktail ( <unk> vodka , <unk> <unk> , fresh squeez grapefruit , jalapeño <unk> ) . it took 15-20 minut to receiv the first drink , which is just silli , but it wa a spectacular concoct . i highli recommend the ripper , it wa refresh and the <unk> of jalapeno did not make it spici , just ad a veri uniqu background flavor . a significantli long amount of time pass yet again to take our dinner order , but luckili we were enjoy each other 's compani enough to not worri too much ( yet ) . i start with the crudo salmon , which wa truli except . i have never had better qualiti salmon , and the preserv lemon & <unk> nut accompani were a perfect pair . for my next cours , i tri the <unk> pasta with prawn . me : `` could you pleas recommend a wine for the prawn <unk> ? '' rush server : `` red or white ? '' me : `` <unk> , i think white would be nice with the prawn ... '' rush server : `` pinot noir . i 'll bring you one . '' while i highli doubt she did n't know pinot noir wa a red , i wa annoy that she did n't listen to me , did n't make eye contact , and did n't recommend a particular brand , just said `` i 'll bring you one '' and ran off . it wa a veri good pinot noir though ( of cours it <unk> she brought me the most expens by the glass . ) my final cours wa the pork chop . it wa a huge , beauti cut of meat , with the fatti edg just start to crisp . howev it wa cook <unk> , which i am awar is the proper , <unk> to eat pork , but i do think it should have been mention to me upon order . i am ok with medium to <unk> , but rare to <unk> is just too much for me . that littl <unk> wa still slightli breath . it wa sear in foie gra and pair with a <unk> <unk> which sound simpli divin , right ? but , there wa too much go on- too much salt , too much season , just too heavi in gener . the salti wa <unk> overpow . the <unk> between cours wa <unk> entre took too long and the supplement came much too fast . speak of the supplement , they were so-so . one wa a dice <unk> salad of sort , but becaus the `` supplement server '' wa also so incred rush he bare had time to <unk> the full descript . i do n't think he bother to even attempt at describ the second supplement . the inattent servic and `` pretti '' good food made for a 3.5 star even .
ya im give 5 star to a fast food place . ive been go to thi burger king forev sinc it is <unk> right down the road from where i live . i have alway had except custom servic there . that is my honest reason for the 5 star . i would have probabl never wrote a review for thi place except for last week it wa late and i wa go through the drive thru for some quick burger . the place is be remodel so you cant go in but the drive thru wa open . they had a new employe work that night . not sure of hi name but the kid with the brace gave me better custom servic than i have reciev in most actual restaur . <unk> and friendli . he realli stood out . that be said it made me realiz that all the employe i have came in contact with there have been except <unk> have been there when they experienc <unk> debit machin go down and after wait in the drive thru forev they gave me my food for free and apolog . kudo to thi locat on custom servic ! i suggest the doubl cheeseburg btw ! : )

thi wa the best facial i 've ever had ! lorna went over my skin thoroughli and we discuss what would be best for my skin . she did n't tri to sell me anyth and she did n't pressur me to buy a packag deal . when you get great servic , you want to come back and lorna know her custom will be back for more great facial ! she said she would contact me in a coupl of day to see how my skin wa do . her studio wa decor realli nice , the tabl wa comfort , and the music and ambianc wa perfect . i had the relax facial with a peel . the leg , feet , hand and arm massag wa a bonu ! my skin feel so soft and smooth ! i will definit be back ! thank lorna ! !

our first trip to thi locat , and we use the drive thru . the employe were super help explain menu item . i 'm not a huge fan of flavor soda so i tri a <unk> ' sugar cooki , which is a smaller version of their frost cooki . my husband love hi raspberri dream dr. pepper . we 'll be back - ani place that offer cooki in a drive thru is a winner in my book ! ( taylor <unk> is right , the cooki are refriger . the wa n't as notic with a sugar cooki as it wa with the chocol chip cooki i got the next time i visit . )
first time here . i watch the tv and saw thi place so i went to tri it . first it 's not a restaur , it 's more of a <unk> stand . my wife order a roast been sandwich and i order a french dip with extra chees . the ladi wa rude take our order . the fresh bread is not bake here it 's in packag on the <unk> ! ! ! the sandwich are big ! ! ! the roast beef wa <unk> high and veri dri . so dri my wife did n't eat it . on my french dip it did not have extra chees ! ! ! ! i do n't care how much it is just put the shit on the sandwich ! <unk> for 2 sandwich . the condiment are in packag not fresh . when you say ny deli i expect way more . i am from ny and thi is not close . it would n't that bad but when your food is not great and your server is rude on top of it ... <unk> realli <unk> me off ! ! ! !
ive been to rachel 's a few time and i keep come back . the food is pretti decent . it american bistro style with natur base product with the option to go super healthi with all natur salad , whole wheat pasta etc . thi trip i had a chicken finger wrap ( <unk> ) which is the best thing ive had thu far , it had a lot of flavor and a yummi dress . thi i will also say for the first time my <unk> fri where actual hot . i think consist need some <unk> i do come back becaus it is a good lunch spot
thi had to be one of the best activ i 've ever done in la vega . we were led by instructor <unk> who wa knowledg and friendli . there were two other instructor that <unk> with us , ca n't rememb their name but they were also veri help . <unk> and the other gave us thorough instruct and tip dure the orient . all of it wa veri simpl and easi to grasp . while out on the tour , they made sure to stop everi so often to let the <unk> group catch up , as well as to make sure we were all ok , and have a good time . it wa awesom , a littl pricey but so worth it in the end . thi experi wa all we could talk about later that night at dinner . such a great time ! highli recommend .
so i went here with my daughter for lunch . i could get sushi from fri 's that is better than thi . the roll fall apart , they do n't even use sushi rice so rice went everywher . i do not recommend the spici tuna and shrimp roll , they use some weird chili <unk> in it and doe n't tast that good . i paid about $ 2 more per roll than i would have at other locat for mediocr sushi , lesson learn i will not be dine here again .
use to go to o face doughnut for mapl bar so i thought id give thi place a tri . wa surpris to see the varieti they had . almost too overwhelm but i did n't let that stop me from tri a varieti of thing . there 's mayb too mani to list , but what definit stood out wa the french toast donut . it 's onli a weekend run but who realli need doughnut 7 day a week ; ) i did the <unk> on a weekli routin for awhil with my bf . it came with hot <unk> mapl syrup , whip butter , and hous made blueberri jam . it wa usual big enough for me but he 's a bigger guy and would also get the blueberri cheesecak donut which he said wa the best sweet pastri he ever had . in addit they also have homemad chocol milk and cold brew on tap which alon is worth the trip . awesom friendli staff and a quick in and out experi . i suggest you get here befor the donut run out
painless servic ! i lock myself out of my hous , within 10 minut someon wa there to get me insid . i wish they would have ask for proof that i should be let in to my hous , but see as all my inform wa lock insid i 'm almost glad they did n't .

the tire center wa rude i stood there for 10 minut befor be acknowledg . then the guy rude ask can i help you . i said ye i need to check and air up my tire with <unk> . he point to the hous and said someth that i could n't hear and i said what . he proceed to turn around and continu work . i then pull up and sat there for 10 minut think he wa go to come sinc i did n't hear what he said . nope noth someon did n't even come to check on me to see if i need help or anyth . it wa the guy in white glass . worst experi ever . i 'm not an idiot i know <unk> to put air in my tire and check then but the fact he just stay back there work tri to answer my question i thought wa so rude .
i book a <unk> thursday ( 4 night stay ) at thi hotel . i stay in the club tower which is about a 10 minut walk to the back of the tropicana properti . the hotel should issu <unk> for the guest to get back and forth from the casino to the club tower becaus it 's way too far from the entranc . then came the room . i wa not at all happi with thi hotel room . i wa assign to a room on the 17th floor and the room smelt like smoke . needless to say , i do n't smoke and i hate the smell of smoke . also the bed sheet had a weird stain on it ( see pictur ) . it look like some type of organ fluid . i call the front desk to ask for a differ room and did n't get an answer after call the first time . call a second time and still no answer . final got an answer after the 3rd call to the front desk . when they answer , the said that the smoki smell wa probabl due to the <unk> floor be a smoke floor so they move me to the 12th floor . the room on the 12th floor wa better and there wa no smokey smell in that room . i also use the tropicana workout facil think it wa includ in my daili rate . unfortun , i wa wrong . i use the hotel gym for 2 day of my 4 day stay . howev , the hotel charg me for 4 day . bewar , thi hotel will charg you $ 35 per day just for use the workout <unk> . if you use it for 1 day , they will charg you for each day of the entir length of your stay . although i had a `` view '' of the vega strip <unk> , you should be made awar that there is a thick black screen that <unk> your view through the window . final , when i call for a late checkout on thursday , the front desk wa <unk> about not let me checkout past 12 noon unless i paid an addit $ <unk> . so , i opt to leav at just befor 12 noon on my last day . howev , on my last day i wa <unk> by hotel staff 4 time between the hour of <unk> . the first time , someon enter my room at <unk> without knock and without announc who they were . then , at 11am , the same person came back state that he had to clean the carpet . at <unk> and <unk> , hotel <unk> servic came ask if they could clean the room . they never did thi on day <unk> of my stay . overal , i am unhappi with thi hotel and have no plan to return . the onli reason whi i stay at thi hotel wa becaus the mgm , where my confer wa be held , had no more room avail .
we came a long way for the all-you-can-eat crab leg and were certainli not disappoint . the crab leg were huge and veri , veri good qualiti . we also had calamari and it too wa great . the servic wa amaz , i have to say . we actual had two folk help us and they were both veri sweet and made sure that we had everyth that we want . i notic that they were also veri accommod to other tabl 's wish . one ladi order two pound of crab leg and ask that they be brought out one <unk> at a time so that they were alway hot . no problem . i realli enjoy thi place . it 's veri <unk> and i like look around a dine room and see famili enjoy a meal togeth . if i could throw anoth half star on there i would , the onli thing keep them from five star is the bathroom . it 's a littl sketchi and the toilet are <unk> . lol

got to be honest i had to ask for direct to find thi spot becaus there 's no sign for it . so after i found it i walk down the long hallway to a littl pizza counter . the menu is pretti small so i got two slice of white and a <unk> which wa alright . i wa drunk so the pizza probabl would 've tast better . the price were <unk> high it wa someth like 5 buck for a slice . it 's not a bad littl spot if you can find and the pizza is pretti good .
after visit the bank in the same build , i thought i would stop by for some sushi . it wa earli afternoon and i had n't eaten lunch yet . it wa quiet and the onli peopl eat wa the staff for lunch . in term of the servic , i thought it wa ok. obvious , i wa the onli person there , so i could n't realli verifi the servic level . i can say thi though , the food came out realli quickli . from when i order to when the food arriv , wa about 5 minut . now look at the speed of the servic , i can onli say that most of it wa prepar way <unk> fish wa realli fresh . i realli like that . the gyoza on the other hand wa a littl bit cold . it tast like it wa <unk> , but they did n't take the time to reheat it . the <unk> roll wa pretti good . it wa suppos to be cold , so i ca n't tell if it wa made way befor or made fresh . it tast pretti good though . over all , it wa a pretti good lunch . it wa n't too expens too . the dish came in at $ <unk>
love the work and they were super fast ! ! ! def will be come here from now on . they also had a huge select of color to pick from
it 's close . not a soul wa there and no light on and the sign indic they should be open . i suggest you call first .
what a club ! we had an amaz time at thi place and the servic could not have been better . grant the entir night start with a call to a great concierg compani call red carpet vip . the decor of the place wa crazi nice , never seen a club like that ever and i been to plenti of club all over the us and the countri . vega club in gener are someth els ( check out <unk> ) . they had girl in bath <unk> with just <unk> and more dancer at tao bench . also sinc there is a great guy to girl ratio , the odd are in guy favor sinc there is so mani group of ladi that get in with no problem . i 've parti almost everywher in vega and i can honestli say that noth amount to the fun you 'll have in tao . no other night club is as attent as the staff at tao . we order bottl servic and it seem like the waitress never left our side - they stuck with us , danc with us and made sure we had a great time ! !
have the <unk> server ever . i order <unk> pork with rib and gave me just <unk> pork . complain and the server came at the front and talk to the other server . she came back and told me that they dont have rib anymor . sure , whatev ! i can definit see rib hang at <unk> front . then they alway give me my bill when i 'm not even halfway done my food . thi restaur should have a good custom train !
order taco with everyth to go . servic wa fast and veri friendli . the taco were great and doubl in size compar to most street taco . the onli complaint our group had wa two out of the five taco had too much fatti meat . so my onli recommend would be to <unk> up the meat a littl more .
after be in the valley for over 2 year , i 've final found my go to repair guy ! ! <unk> will respond in a time manner and get your instrument in asap . hi servic is second to none and the fact that he will do it while you wait is <unk> of . he ha work with some of the biggest name in the music industri and hi work reflect it . knowledg and skill are the 2 best word to describ <unk> <unk> .
made an appoint thi morn for an inspect . i arriv and wa immedi greet , and they had my car in and out within 20 minut for 30 buck . no complaint here at all . these smaller repair shop are much <unk> and honest than the larg chain one i 've frequent in the past .
slow . horribl slow . appear to have no sens of commun at all . thi locat ha no awar of time or how to handl order . just a downright terribl experi ! and it 's sad when you work at a well know place that tend to frequent your establish ... just say ...
thi guy is the best . we 've had to call him twice now and he 's incred prompt , courteou and reason . we call him for the second time in a week last night . he came right away at <unk> . he rang the <unk> about 30 minut after our call ... he wa alreadi done . realli . it 's so hard to find realli good servic nowaday . and thi guy is excel . pleas support hi busi !

i grew up eat at thi place , a local institut in north la vega . if you 've never been here befor you should tri the prime rib , alway cook to perfect alway juici never dri meat . the dessert are amaz , i love their milkshak . the atmospher is <unk> but the servic and food is alway outstand ! <unk> . get a bloodi mari you 'll thank me later .
thi review is base off of custom <unk> the last 3 time i have order take out i have been extrem disappoint by the servic and the wait especi due to the fact that my order wa place prior to 6 pm and <unk> <unk> ... unfortun thi downtown restaur ha stop care . the realiti is that it doe not take 90 minut to make fri rice and when peopl are order take out it 's a conveni becaus they are n't in the mood to go to the groceri store or cook that night .
i 'm give them 3 star becaus all i did wa order juic onlin but let me tell you ! there juic suck ! ! ! ! ! ! i let it steep for week and still wa horribl ! it ha a weird flavor <unk> they add ! i mean bad ! do n't buy there juic ! from top vapor ! ! ! ! i threw it out ! mayb other stuff is good but that wa the worst juic i ever had !

thi pharmaci wa the onli one in town that had a prescript i need . they were nice over the phone when i call to ask , and super nice when i drop off my prescript . of cours ... they wait until i got home to call me to tell me that they do n't take my insur ... but be the onli place i could get thi script fill , i ask them to fill it anyway . without insur it wa onli $ 18 . not bad at all . servic wa great . i would come back here if they took my insur .
not to sound like a complet <unk> <unk> , but the servic wa perfectli fine . charg for extra sauc is a littl annoy and the main issu wa the yell in the back of the store . again , i 'm not one to make mean review or what not , but i wish they would n't charg extra for small thing
<unk> sub-par . yeah ... they have fri chees curd - it 's wisconsin - there will be chees curd ... <unk> they 'll probabl be good ... anywher . it 's not a testament to the old fashion - it 's a testament to wisconsin 's qualiti of chees . i had the fri fish special and felt like i 'd order van de <unk> 's . too loud - too long to wait . tri the burger as well , which wa recommend to me as one of the best in the citi . i do not agre . whether or not they put a fri egg on stuff ... it 's not <unk> . you can put <unk> on a <unk> - it 's a <unk> . hype .
<unk> vapor ha been my go to shop for almost 2 year and they have the best juic and the best servic i 've seen out of the shop in the area . the custom servic is outstand and they realli know what they 're talk about <unk> is my go to guy for question and for advic on anyth vape relat . <unk> is a call dude is veri help and know hi stuff too . all in all veri good experi deal with all of the peopl that work there , and it 's my favorit shop by far . <unk> <unk>
thi shop ha a lot to offer in term of servic and equip . them be a dealership is good and they 're realli help toward new <unk> . i got a <unk> singl speed bike and they help me pick out a bike along with accessori . i paid half when i order it , and paid the other half when i pick it up . when i left the shop they even offer me to do slight chang for free like adjust my <unk> height . i had n't bought some <unk> tool after buy my bike for about 2 month , but i got them here . what realli surpris me is that they rememb me and what bike i got . if you bought a bike from here you get 10 % off accessori . i got everyth i need , for a flat at least , here . multi tool , mini pump , <unk> , a <unk> bag , and some tire <unk> . the servic is good when buy accessori and again , they 're realli help when make a select . overal everyth they do is what i expect and more . help , and also doe n't break the bank with the deal they offer . the qualiti of their stuff differ as well , from minimum to excel .
i love thi place . it 's cheap , authent and tasti . like the bbq pork on rice especi .
my famili and i come to thi place often . you must order a chees crisp . they are to die for ! the portion are massiv if you get the combo dinner . i would suggest mayb share one with someon sinc they are so big . unless you want leftov which is not a bad thing ! if i could say one neg thing about the place , the seat definit need to be <unk> or someth becaus they are look ( and feel rough ) but that wo n't stop us from be back !
went there for lunch , and the select wa poor . after the waitress , who also made the <unk> and the food gave us our order , we were disappoint again with the size and tast of the food . wo n't be go back again .

thi place is a <unk> of good deal and well laid out shelv with a <unk> of well stock shelv fill with a wide varieti of interest and use merchandis you will not be abl to find elsewher . it is n't all import either . the reason i rate it 3 star is becaus you can expect to wait in line at the till for 15 minut while custom come in with <unk> of <unk> up <unk> win while the one and onli cashier on duti sort them all out , one at a time at the slowest speed imagin anywher . all thi while there is a <unk> 10 to 12 deep . thi is the reason i stop go there a decad ago and i see that noth ha chang . they have the slowest checkout anywher and their checkout equip is <unk> .

'' i found thi quit <unk> and as a busi owner myself , i would never repli to a potenti client with such a statement .
i love both locat ! i hope to see more locat pop up , and wipe out the competit ! it doe n't matter which locat i visit , i 'm not treat like a custom , i 'm treat like famili ! <unk> at henderson is awesom . veri profession ! both locat are mayb a $ <unk> uber ride from the strip . you 'll save at least $ 100.00 on food and drink , rather than the strip . the food is upscal , but at a reason price . i highli recommend tri the lobster mac and chees ! it 's delici and fresh ! both locat get fresh aliv lobster daili ! thi is the onli bar i recommend in vega . sport fan especi , both locat have tv 's everywher . also a movi screen for all big game .
a solid `` meh . '' the burger are overcook and not particularli flavor . ad bacon , chili , or <unk> doe n't realli chang that . given the price tag i 'd say it 's not realli worth it
i have to give a <unk> rate here to tri and <unk> some of the terribl review , i do n't know if we are talk about the same <unk> . thi is a small restaur on st. clair near <unk> . it 's surprisingli modern interior is fit with a bar and a tv screen . there are usual one or 2 cook and a singl waitress so the servic can be a tad slow at time . i make it a point to come here with the fam on the weekend for a nice brunch . they have a great select of lunch food from egg and bacon to omelett , sandwich and wrap . everyth come with salad , home fri chip wedg , or sweet potato fri . the amaz thing here besid the food which in and of itself deserv 4 star , is the price . the lunch price are unbeat . today i had a smoke salmon sandwich with avocado , <unk> , onion and a side salad with their great hous dress . all thi and a beverag of your choic for $ 6.50 ! in fact you can have ani sandwich or omelett + side + drink for $ 6.50 ... <unk> .

my husband and i we 're realli look forward to the new chines restaur . we went on a friday night . the place wa empti but there wa loud talk and cook sound come from the kitchen as if the place wa pack . i order sesam chicken with lo main and soup . my husband order beef and broccoli . we wait forev for our food , again we were the onli peopl in there . the food arriv in take out contain , which wa fine howev the food wa hot , temperatur hot , it wa <unk> . we wait a while and blew on it to cool down , still it wa <unk> hot . i burnt the roof of my mouth tri to eat a piec of chicken . the food wa bland so my effort were for noth . my husband food wa just as bland and tasteless . then they brought us out soup which again wa to hot even after blow on it . i 'm sure there is a health violat for serv food at 900 degre . i think the onli way to get the food that hot is by a <unk> . we wo n't be back ever . china go go is china no no .
david <unk> and i agre that have dinner at <unk> wa like go home after a long <unk> , where our <unk> make all of our favorit dish and keep refil our plate even after we are way beyond full . except in thi case , we were do the refil ourselv ... although serv <unk> , the food ha a definit <unk> feel . i 've never had filipino food befor , but if i were a bet woman , i 'd say that thi is about as authent as you can get ! the food look a littl stale sit out in the open the way they have it - and honestli i 'm surpris that they are abl to keep the <unk> out - but you can definit tell that the food is prepar with a lot of care . for the select of dish that wa avail dure the dinner hour , the $ 8.99 price tag wa quit reason . now on to my favorit part of the meal : the steam pork bun . <unk> 's steam pork bun are <unk> the best i 've ever had . better than those at ani dim sum restaur i 've been to , both in the state and <unk> . if it wa n't for all of the refin <unk> , i would probabl have the bun for breakfast , lunch , and dinner ! final , the owner of the restaur is a super sweet filipino ladi ! as we were wrap up our meal , she stop by with a takeout <unk> full of <unk> ( sweet sticki rice steam in banana leav ) for us to take home and told us to grab some more on the way out . serious , how sweet is she ? we probabl look like broke colleg <unk> tip : bring cash to tip . there is no place to tip on the receipt if you are pay by card , but they definit deserv it ! : )
<unk> did a fantast job replac light fixtur and a kitchen <unk> in my hous , as well as patch a hole in my ceil . he wa profession and on time . i highli recommend him and alreadi plan contact him for other work in a few month .
i had an absolut horribl experi here with <unk> . he wa entir <unk> toward work with me in the design for after hi origin <unk> wa n't what i had in mind . he repeatedli cancel my actual appoint , said he would let me know when we could reschedul , and then basic <unk> me . regardless of how <unk> unprofession it wa , it wa more <unk> than anyth becaus thi piec wa incred import to me , and i had heard such good thing about <unk> beforehand . it honestli just seem like he could n't be ask to bother put the effort in . extrem disappoint .
i came here with a few friend on tuesday night to take part of their $ 1 oyster special . right off the bat , we order 150 osyt . the waiter wa a littl taken back but he wa glad that he would n't have to worri about not sell out sinc they order 200 oyster for that day . we also order drink and other dish as well but we were mainli excit to feast on the oyster . we order so mani that they had to get everyon from the kitchen to help shuck the osyt . we had to wait quit a bit but that wa expect . when the oyster came , it wa a <unk> to <unk> on . it cover our entir tabl ! there were 3 sauc to choos from ; a <unk> , a garlic <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> and of cours lot of horseradish . my wife want the cocktail sauc but they did n't have ani but the waiter spoke to the chef and guess what ? ? ? he decid to make the cocktail sauc from scratch for us . we were greatli appreci and it tast fantast ! after polish all of the 150 osyt , we start on the other dish . we order 2 dish of grill calamari , 1 poutin and a farmer 's plate which compris of wild <unk> sausag , mash potato and slow cook rib . overal , we had a great time . the waiter wa fantast and <unk> great servic to our tabl . the food wa also superb and not to mention the oyster were super fresh ! highli recommend thi <unk> and we will definit return for anoth feast in the futur .
friday night music so loud you ca n't think , or talk . otherwis , the food and servic wa great .
i <unk> it . great place to go when you are in vega , but bewar of the wait time . everybodi and their mom want to go here .
love the <unk> <unk> ! ! ! you will also love the place . if you intend to see the peac bridg do n't forget to check out thi place as well .
thi place wa worth my $ 25 ! ! ! the dinner wa simpli amaz ! they liter have everyth you could think of plu more . the steak and prime rib wa perfect medium and juici . you could still tast the chunk of potato in the mash potato . you could make your own <unk> in anyway you desir ! the best part wa probabl the seafood ! <unk> amount of crab leg and shrimp dip in juici butter and pepper ! amaz ! our server wa on point with take our plate and refil our drink . he also gave us our own bottl of hand sanit . the onli slow part of thi place is that if you 're not a guest at the rio , then the line of enter could take forev . it 's a self serv machin and some peopl take forev . but other than that , <unk> ! ! !
nice small cafe serv southern comfort food , made from local grown produc by pleasant and help staff .
i 'm alway late to a parti . in thi case , a few year late . i have alway want to tri la <unk> , but could never find a reason to intent stop here . in the past i rare visit thi section of the citi , which is a pretti poor excus . anyway , wrong have been right and all is good in the world . at least for me . walk into a bakeri is quit possibl one of my favorit thing in the world . i love me some bread and the smell of fresh bake bread take me back to my mom 's kitchen . it wa quit the process for my mom , so my appreci for a fresh bread is definit there . it 's hard not to have your mouth water when you look at what they have to offer . i seem to be a <unk> of habit , or at least <unk> action . which is probabl whi i <unk> on item that i know have not let me down in the past . which is the case with the baguett <unk> <unk> . where my bacon fan at ? i see you out there . a baguett bake with bacon bit and parmesan chees , how could you pass that up ? it 's a great snack to have and share . i have also had a focaccia top with pizza top which is quit amaz as well . but the whole reason you come here is becaus you want to indulg . satisfi that sweet tooth of your . my first visit i had gotten the delic de <unk> . i love pistachio and thi did not hold back on flavor one bit . right mixtur that did not make it too sweet . my latest visit i decid on the eclair au chocolat . thi thi is what make you want to come back . the fill in thi wa so rich that you wonder whi you never had someth like thi befor . oh how i wish i wa there right now . i want me some sweet badli .
the food is good , and the price are reason . howev , the servic vari and can be incred slow at time ( but sometim it 's pretti good ) . there seem to be no <unk> of the staff , but i do like their breakfast special so i keep come back .
thi place is awesom ! the staff ask if it wa our first time there ( which it wa ) and hook us up with a free signatur roll . for be so far from the <unk> , thi place wa good . i enjoy it . i will definit be back .
i could not be happier with the bathtub <unk> <unk> did yesterday . profession , clean and fast ! had i known it wa thi easi , i would have done it sooner !
i just have to write thi review becaus usual i have the worst experi at <unk> due to the server . but today aaron realli impress me , he wa on top of the refil and had the best attitud . i 'm so glad he wa our server today and to top it off the food wa delici no doubt !
my famili ha been shop at thi smith 's for nearli 18 year . it is consist one of the best supermarket i have been in . it is not <unk> 's or whole food ( but those are differ <unk> all togeth ! ) perhap it is the larg size with the spaciou <unk> that ha me <unk> with thi place but they also have a realli larg select of your typic supermarket item . good deli , great select of most everi product . their produc and veget are actual pretti good as well ! i feel thi is almost like a costco as you can buy a lot of thing in <unk> here . help is realli awesom as well . park is great ... <unk> i 'm from san francisco and park is a blood sport .
alright , who 's readi to get their raunchi on ? ! wait , what ? what 'd you mean ? it not a strip club ? oh shuck ! with a name like shanghai <unk> - i can onli think of how success thi would be if it were <unk> to an <unk> neighbourhood in shanghai as a gentleman 's club . ala , there were no sexi ladi here . onli server with plenti of <unk> , and a lot of `` interest '' charact that dine here . almost as interest as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> ? those belong more in a hangov movi than it doe at a diner . or mayb i 'm just not the right target audienc for such `` artist '' display . speak of art , you will find a wall of it for sale . it veri <unk> if you ask me - but hey if it float your boat ... i came arm with a team buy voucher . i had heard that thi wa one of the go-to place to get some decent food if you 're a night <unk> as they are open ridicul late . the booth will make ani girl <unk> about her size - damn are they narrow . if you are <unk> than thi probabl is n't the place to go . on the flip side , if you 're a <unk> , most of your <unk> wo n't end up on your lap becaus there 's but a <unk> crack of space between your upper bodi and the actual tabl . the menu is typic of a diner - fri , burger with some fusion item thrown in there like noodl bowl , fri rice . i order the ghetto chicken - mostli becaus i wa <unk> drawn to the name of the dish . it wa a disappoint . kfc , which cost significantli less doe up chicken better than thi place . the batter wa a brown that wa <unk> to belong on a piec of fri chicken , and <unk> than hospit food . the actual chicken itself had no tast either . it came serv on a bed of ( burnt ) carrot , asparagu and mash potato . sadli , the best part of the dish were the mash potato , and even they need a sprinkl of salt . william <unk> got a burger with blue chees and mushroom . the blue chees ad a nice creami to the burger but the mushroom were <unk> <unk> . the sweet potato fri were <unk> to look at , as they were <unk> and not veri crispi . the onli memor part of the night ( other than the <unk> male patron who sat behind us <unk> hi poor femal dine companion about hi <unk> idea ) were the pierogi . we got our with char siu pork , ginger , <unk> and chili pepper flake . it wa top with a <unk> of sour cream . i must say the sour cream is a nice touch , as they smooth over an otherwis <unk> and rather <unk> pierogi <unk> . the insid wa fill with potato and chees . i thought the bit of sweet from the char siu <unk> and the spici chili pepper flake were great flavour enhanc . verdict : for 3 food item and 2 drink from the bar , our bill came up to about $ <unk> . that 's a littl steep for a diner . at about $ 10 for a base burger and then $ <unk> $ 2 for extra top , a burger can set you back $ 15 . i think that for a diner , their price point is a littl off - but then again i 'm sure rent in thi neighbourhood is n't cheap . for food that your dad can grill up on a bbq or that your european <unk> can make , i 'd say eat at home instead of dish out at shanghai <unk> . howev , sinc i do n't have a european <unk> - i 'd probabl come back here - but onli for the pierogi .
total overr . dumpl feel overcook so the dough feel mushi . you can easili make dumpl at home that tast better and cost you a <unk> of what they charg . edit : it look like they fail dine safe multipl time . so it 's not just bad food you 're get there .
if you go at night it 's pretti and there 's cheap <unk> that 's about it . i went dure the day and it wa <unk> usual i can find fun anywher i go not thi place though . it wa dirti and full of bum and <unk> everywher . the shop were nasti the casino were dirti as hell . the onli good thing wa the cheap beer that we got insid the casino . there 's noth there but a few gift shop and the casino . we ate at the place at the end by the park garag ( seafood place ) sinc it look fairli decent from the <unk> . it wa nasti insid i felt dirti just sit there . i just had some shot and beer sinc i did n't feel comfort eat there after i tri the shrimp cocktail ... which tast old and burnt . i would come back to ride the <unk> at night ... other than that it wa a bore wast of time ! tip : stay on the strip !
had a decent time but it wa not nearli as much fun as i had do someth similar with the vega off road experi last year . here are my <unk> 1 ) what peopl realli want is to shoot some gun and take some cool photo . the websit for <unk> and burger show peopl hold cool gun and or get readi to shoot where you can clearli see the person do the shoot . when you arriv they tell you you can onli take pictur from a small barrier behind the <unk> and a littl to the side . thi mean you are take a pictur of someon back and it could be anyon for all the person look at the pictur know . that suck from an i want to rememb thi experi <unk> . 2 ) the packag i got say you also get to `` walk the hoover dam bridg '' . i have never been to the hoover dam so i assum thi meant i would be on the hoover dam . not so . i got to take a quick hike to a bridg that look at the hoover dam from quit a distanc <unk> what ? ? ?
i have been stay at the vdara for the better part of a year on a regular basi , at least onc or twice a month . over the past year i have alway been a huge custom advoc for the vdara and told my friend and busi associ that if they are travel to vega your hotel should the their destin of choic . howev over the last coupl of month , my custom experi ha been less than stellar and i will no longer frequent your hotel dure my la vega busi trip . here is a <unk> of my experi and how they have effect by decis . in speak with my busi counter part , who stay as frequent at caesar as i do at the vdara , he is upgrad with each visit to either a higher floor or larger room . in addit he is alway thank for hi loyal patronag and told how much they appreci hi continu busi . on my most recent stay ( march 2 - march 5 ) when i check in , i explain to the employe that mani of my previou room charg had not credit to my <unk> account . she said she would look them up for me and when she access my file she said `` boy , you stay here a lot '' and then gave me a card with a phone number to <unk> for assist with my issu . no , thank you for your loyalti mr harri or i am so sorri for thi inconveni mr harri ; just i cant help you but here is a card with a number to call . stellar servic . dure my previou stay in februari i left two iphon <unk> in the room and ask dure my current visit if they could be in a lost and found . the front desk employe wa veri nice and call the depart for in that morn , but then found out that it did not open until 11 am . she said that she would follow up and call me on my mobil phone with an answer . to thi date i still have not heard from anyon , so i will assum noth wa turn in or there wa no follow up from the employe . i wa also quit shock on tuesday morn when i went to the fit center to find out it wa under construct . a nice employe at the spa said that i could use the aria fit center at no charg if i show by room key , but as it wa <unk> degre that morn and i wa wear short and a <unk> that wa not ideal . when i ask where the fit center wa locat in the aria she said that i could ask the door man for direct when i arriv . realli ? ? should thi not have been someth that the front desk notifi me of when check in ? should there not have been some map provid to me at check in with thi inform ? whi wa i pay a daili resort fee of $ <unk> a day and not have use of a fit center ? love . to your credit , the valet team are amaz . when i arriv each time they alway say `` welcom back mr harri '' even though they have not seen me for two to three week . perhap thi is becaus i have a bright orang car or becaus i am a big <unk> , but they are the onli one who treat me like a loyal and <unk> custom . i would recommend whoever manag that depart is promot to manag the front desk for a better overal custom experi . so now i have a total reward card and have book my first room at caesar next week . i realiz that i will be start over again with a new program , but i am look for a compani to recogn my loyalti and thank me for my patronag . somehow your hotel seem to have lost that focu and for that , i am truli disappoint .
the best <unk> <unk> ! after all these year , i still have n't found anoth that i would <unk> inhal fast enough . alway crispi and moist at the same <unk> , you can never go wrong ! thi pair with garlic rice and <unk> ( pickl papaya ) can get me to smile ear to ear after . definit my favourit stop at downtown toronto .

my favorit coffe shop ! ! staff is friendli , ambienc is great and the food is out of thi world !
i 'll be honest , i probabl would never have come here if it wa n't for the fact that my friend had a total reward dine coupon , and thi wa one of the place to choos from . but i 'm glad i did ! despit it total <unk> <unk> ( in the flamingo , no celebr chef , no <unk> or <unk> ) , thi turn out to be a solid steakhous experi with a littl extra <unk> in the form of a uniqu and fabul foodi appet call the bacon <unk> trio ( photo <unk> , but doe n't do it <unk> ) . thi is serv as 6 slice of <unk> bacon ( about <unk> '' thick ! ) and a roast jalapeno pepper on a huge <unk> block of pink <unk> salt , with bleu chees and spice and a pot of <unk> syrup dip sauc . fuck , yeah ! i 'm not even a big bacon fan , and thi wa amaz ! the rest of the food wa good , but noth special : i had the garbag salad and a <unk> bake potato , both of which were great , but noth you could n't get elsewher . my friend had a filet ( $ <unk> with total reward card , $ <unk> without ) , which he said wa fine as well , but again , noth you could n't get a million other place in vega . we also share a bottl of wine . overal , despit the `` noth special '' <unk> of the food , it wa one of the best meal i 've had in a long time ! grant , i wa high at the time , so that may have had some bear on my tast bud ... but i honestli think it wa the bacon appet that set the tone and realli made the meal . that thing wa realli good ! servic wa good , ambianc is sort of <unk> -- sort of a <unk> version of the sort of <unk> steakhous decor you see at other more expens strip steakhous . there are tv all over the wall , which at the time of my visit were play an nfl game , <unk> a definit casual vibe -- and the guest were dress to match ; flip <unk> , board short , veri casual dress . but some of the tv were also play <unk> of old photo of vega , which i found pretti interest and cool , and <unk> a sort of <unk> vibe . the one sad failur wa the bread basket , which consist of two lame <unk> roll of uninspir <unk> . but , sinc bread is <unk> , thi could actual be look at as a huge plu -- less <unk> nasti to tempt you . anyway , if you must have steak at the flamingo , by all mean i recommend thi place . but there are <unk> interest steakhous experi in town , at similar price point . what i would recommend here is just share appet at the bar -- not sure you can do thi , but they have a pretti <unk> loung out front , with a better <unk> than the actual restaur , and if you could sit here and have some drink with your bacon <unk> , it would be a pretti cool even .
pho <unk> is my go-to <unk> place in the neighbourhood ! it 's in the same plaza as foodi <unk> , which sometim make park a real pain . other than the park issu , thi place is perfect for a cheap , satisfi meal . the broth is great , and the noodl are nice cook ( i ca n't stand soggi pho ! ) . i also realli like their spring roll , which are delight crispi . onc , i put in the wrong order on paper ( i copi down the wrong number for my spring roll ) , but the staff wa nice enough to chang the order , even after the food ha been made . i highli recommend thi place for cheap eat !

thi is n't a bad littl store but it 's the kind of place you 'd go for run of the mill beer like <unk> , <unk> light , etc . decent price and special too .
fantast servic , larg menu , great atmospher , and unbeat locat ! thi is the eaton centr locat , but it 's not exactli <unk> to the eaton centr . you will have to exit either at <unk> & m or best buy and <unk> 's is a few step away . in the summer , it 's a beauti place to get food and drink on their `` patio '' , which is essenti their tabl by the window , except the window are n't there . i came here twice yesterday - onc for lunch and onc dure happi hour . i 'll detail both experi below : i came for lunch with a group of 6 . they do n't allow reserv for lunch hour , but we did n't have to wait for a tabl anyway . we were seat upstair in a booth , and our waiter brought us water right away . i order the california chicken burger with fri for $ 16 . food did n't take long to arriv , and it i appreci that they brought out all 6 dish at onc , unlik other similar restaur chain ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . the fri were a littl salti , but i still thoroughli enjoy my meal . our waiter wa amaz ( i think hi name wa joe , but i 'm not 100 % sure ) . he ask us if everyth wa good with our food twice and at the end of our meal , he play some trivia game with us . if ani one of us got the answer right , he said he would pay for our pop ( we did n't get either of the 2 trivia question right ) . a few hour later , i came back for happi hour . we had a group of 8 or 9 , but they did n't have ani tabl big enough to accommod us so we just kept ad chair to the booth . despit such a larg group and some peopl not actual drink ( like me ) , our waitress , rachel , wa veri sweet and brought drink quickli . happi hour also includ food so there 's someth for everyon ! overal , food and servic is great , but thi place is definit on the pricier side . for around $ 20 per entre , i would expect bigger portion . locat is veri conveni , especi sinc my school is right next door , so ill definit be back again soon !
compar to the locat on walnut street . they have the absolut worst costum servic ! ! ! i call to tell them i wa tri to find the place and ask if she could give me direct from <unk> way . she told me she could n't becaus she take a bu to work . i end up find it on my own . it wa liter right around the corner . but i wa <unk> i wa n't go to get there in time to get my cake . there wa a <unk> with my cake . i order it to be pick up at the walnut street locat , and here it wa deliv to market squar which put a <unk> in my day becaus i had to go into town to pick it up . after tell the girl at the counter about the <unk> , she did n't even apolog or offer a cooki to help eas the problem . the girl who wait on me had a person of a rock . unbeliev . i will never be back to market squar locat . they do n't seem veri kind nor <unk> . boo ... market squar locat . boo .
do yourself a <unk> and avoid thi place ! mayb i am be a littl <unk> but i came here with the boy friend for all you can eat ... let just say bad mistak ! the food from the kitchen is the reason whi i even gave thi dump 1 star . the maki are so <unk> done i could have done a better job , as well the special roll were hard to choke down ( we could onli eat the center and dump the rest ) . all in all , worst sushi place ever ! ! ! save your $ $ and go to <unk> sushi !

you need a reserv or els you 'll be wait a long time outsid . the decor is a bit tacki and it 's dirti . the tabl , chair and menu were dirti and sticki . i did like the concept of thi restaur . so much thing to choos from and it doe n't come in big quantiti so you can tast a lot of thing without be to full . person i did n't like the food , everyth tast the same , some kind of spice or someth . not a great choic of alcohol , shot were super expens . the wine wa good : ) if you wan na tri someth new , thi is a place for you !
some stuff like our chees appet wa a bit prici , but the food and servic wa excel . we would definit eat there again .
if you 're will to come to the cheesecak factori for a bite to eat one day , come dure happi hour is a must ! it 's from <unk> pm everi weekday and it 's <unk> alcohol drink and select appet . my two friend and i came here dure happi hour and we were expect it to be a littl busi , but it realli wa n't onc we walk in ... of cours it 's a wednesday afternoon . i tri the fri mac and chees , which wa excel , along with a $ <unk> margarita . what a deal that wa . i 'm glad i came dure happi hour .
quick and easi <unk> and titl and registr servic . the park lot is horribl crowd and small .
ye they are fast but if you hire someon to throw your food togeth that is what you get . alot of noth to the sandwich . will not be back !
my workout friend recommend <unk> 's for an amaz breakfast and so we decid to drop in on <unk> . we walk in with no one els in line , i stand there for a few minut tri to read what i think is the menu . i realiz the menu were on paper by where you order . i read over it and the breakfast burrito immedi stand out . i tell the girl take my order that i would like that breakfast burrito and instead of the egg if i could get egg white . she tell me no becaus the burrito are made in the morn and ca n't be taken apart and <unk> <unk> . i then then order the turkey burger as an altern . my 3 friend and i head outsid to the patio to enjoy the weather and talk . after about 10 minut we see a woman get up from her seat <unk> and head into the restaur ... ... ... .. and anoth 20 minut pass and a man also doe the same thing ... ... ... .. sure enough we had to wait 45 minut for our food and thi is whi everyon wa becom so <unk> . i could n't bare to see thi place on a busi day albeit my turkey burger wa pretti decent , the servic , wait time , and <unk> to make alter were a real turn off for me .
that hit the spot ! while we were visit la vega we had a crave for some good mexican food and were not disappoint . thi place is worth the trip away from the strip for sure . i would definit come here again . our parti had the shrimp taco , chees enchilada , chile relleno , carnita taco , and shrimp cocktail and we like it all ! price are more than reason , and they cook with <unk> and <unk> oil which made it veri easi to eat here with a peanut allerg person in our parti . the staff and manag are veri friendli and welcom as well .
thi place use to be my <unk> , but off late the servic ha declin and the qualiti of food is not the same . they open up anoth branch at danforth and perhap that could be one of the reason ?
i would give thi 5 star except for one thing , it 's onli mexican food . how much can you dress up mexican food ... realli ? the place wa veri clean and well decor . the hostess wore beauti tradit mexican dress . we were immedi greet and shown to our seat . the <unk> man in the corner wa a bit loud , but not obnoxi so . he went out of hi way to entertain our kid with some person attent , a song while wear a funni mask . ( they love it ! ) . as a matter of fact , the entir staff were complet friendli and help . everyon went out of their way to make sure our experi wa pleasant and enjoy . the price were veri reason too . there 's not much you can do with mexican food , let 's be honest . but it wa veri good , as mexican food goe . the experi and custom servic we were given earn <unk> <unk> <unk> 4 and a half star in my book . i highli recommend thi restaur .
thi is my first time at pan and i 'm just blown away ... the atmospher is so <unk> but classic , with dim light , beauti <unk> and detail in the ceil , wine rack everywher and <unk> booth and <unk> floor . it 's intim and quiet , which i love , great place for a date for two but even a famili night . there are some tabl by the window for a nice view of the danforth , but also a back portion of the restaur which is more privat . they also have a small patio which is nice for warm weather . the servic is amaz , the waiter cater to your everi need happili and in a time manner . the owner are so care and happi and ensur you leav happi no matter what ! the menu is pretti reason price for what you 're get . they have a `` <unk> '' option too , for $ 25 a one person can get one entre , one app and one dessert . not bad ! tonight we ate the <unk> , steak , villag salad , pasta and <unk> fish for entre , and the saganaki and calamari for appet . everybodi wa happi with the meal , the food came quickli but wa cook to perfect . i 've never had a steak melt in my mouth like that . the saganaki wa so <unk> , and i 've tri a <unk> of saganaki be greek and all . also befor you order they serv you warm pita with five differ greek spread that are authent , fresh and delici . i also tri the local pinot noir which wa light and smooth , and had a cappuccino to wash everyth down with a tast of everi dessert on the menu . dessert portion are small but rich and tast , serv with fruit and whip cream . the cappuccino wa delight . we did n't leav a singl bite left of anyth . i will definit be come back . love thi place soooo much . one of the better greek restaur on the danforth .
uninspir and tasteless menu . good servic . surprisingli busi on a friday night . would not recommend unless i did n't like you . probabl a one star situat but my compani wa good so overal a posit experi .
i use to love thi restaur but after thi past experi , i 'm never go back . the wait wa long ( about an hour and a half ) which wa typic . but thi time , the cook we had . nope ! the server were veri nice . everyth wa pretti quick with our appet but watch the main cours be made ... i almost did n't eat it . but it cost so much and we wait so long i figur i should suck it up . the cook ( <unk> ) wa not a clean individu . he wipe hi hand on hi <unk> a lot . unlik the server , he did n't use glove when handl the food . it wa disgust . is thi the standard ? are peopl okay with thi ? becaus i 'm not . i could n't finish my meal . thi guy would n't stop touch stuff with hi bare hand ! and that <unk> ! while thi wa go on ( i wa just focus on my food ) , my friend wit interact between him and the other patron next to us . thi cook name `` <unk> '' , veri obvious favor and <unk> <unk> patron . he made facial express and neg <unk> toward the <unk> at the bar . serv white peopl first and practic went in order of the shade of peopl 's skin ! thi guy is a racist and he 's a dirti cook to boot . the way he wa act . so obviou . never go back there . vega is a veri divers citi . how is thi guy get away with it ? ! my friend and i are veri disappoint . edit : read past review , i have now seen that thi is n't the first time racist dirti cook have done thi . wish i would of read these befor thi happen .
first time here for a friend birthday celebr . sinc we roll with guy , it wa more logic to book a cabana . our wa situat by the <unk> , so we saw a lot of <unk> . the venu itself wa <unk> ! if you 've been to <unk> at the wynn , then you 'll love <unk> . it 's <unk> bigger and decor wa magnific . music wa good and so were the peopl we met throughout the night . definit a must go when in vega . <unk> warn : guy or girl ... on saturday , must go earli or els you 'll be stuck wait in a long line outsid . unless you have a <unk> there , must go earli !
i want to thank everyon at forward for everyth they did for us . our busi wa <unk> recent and it wa veri stress for my husband and i to go through thi . in the end , the matter wa resolv success . our account and the support staff at forward took care of everyth and it eas our stress greatli . these peopl know tax ! we would recommend them .
noth <unk> for a starbuck . barista are pretti nice . lineup are realli long around lunch time due to the high school . servic is kinda slow though .
we went to a small get togeth that my nephew host by the pool in the earli afternoon on a weekday befor memori day . he ha live in the complex for the last 6 month . he had prepar food and brought it all from hi apart to the grill area at the pool . he had invit a few friend , most of whom are <unk> offic or offic <unk> or girlfriend . as we were all <unk> visit in one small section of the pool area by the grill one of the manag came over and ( in front of everyon ) <unk> demand that he show hi `` pool card . '' he said wa never issu a `` pool card '' and gave hi apart number , name and room mate name . she said that he had to have a pool card to be at the pool and that even if he had hi pool card he wa onli allow to have two guest at the pool . are you kid me ? peopl who live in apart are onli allow to have two friend ? first of all , she embarrass him in front of hi friend , demand a pool card that had never been issu to him or to hi room mate . could she have not taken him asid for her <unk> ? i felt so bad for him . he see thi same woman in the offic sever time a week and yet she claim to not recogn him as a resid . ultim she `` let him go '' with a warn and we were allow to stay after a few <unk> comment about how a group of peopl would <unk> with the resid enjoy of the pool . ( there were two other `` resid at the larg pool area at the time ) if , in fact , resid of thi complex are onli allow to have two friend at the pool and can not host a small get togeth around the larg grill and bar area then they should make sure that they do n't repres otherwis when sell resid a leas . one of the sell point to my nephew and hi room mate wa the pool area with the entertain area for their use . they appar fail to mention that they could onli have two guest . it is a veri nice complex . it is just a shame that resid can onli share it with `` two friend '' at a time .
we ate here earlier today . the food and servic were outstand . the attent to detail in thi restaur is way abov par . i had the sea bass which wa perfect . my wife had the crab cake and thoroughli enjoy them . we will be return to fleme in the futur .
consist terribl . the food is alway okay . but the servic is <unk> . we 've been here three time over the past few year and it 's alway the same . i use to be a server so i 'm veri understand but the servic here is unbeliev .
nice sit-down restaur . staff is friendli . i like all of the choic of ingredi . the onli problem is that you can not choos too mani at one time becaus the bowl are too small . at least you can go up to the grill as mani time as you want but you may be wait for a while in line . also , the meat is frozen and cut into thin <unk> and i do n't like that .

have move out to chandler from phoenix , i wa pretti spoil on good mexican food there , so i had to find some place out here . thi place is pretti decent . it look veri mexican with the bright yellow build . you ca n't miss it . they have a bar area which is usual not in use dure the <unk> . i 've eaten here 3 time so far . the first time i got take out . i alway get the number 1 , 3 carn <unk> taco plate . the second time the rice wa overcook and the bean tast old , but the next time they were good . the taco are alway good , they put some special bbq sauc on the taco as the owner point out to me . i do wish they had self serv fountain drink , but other than that , as long as i can get some good taco , i 'm cool . like thi place .
the best mac and chees i 've had ever ! ! ! and the steak wa good too . but the mac and chees is the reason i 'll be go back for . the servic can be quit slow . they realli realli take their time with the food . wait almost an hour just to get the appet and they forgot about our mac and chees ! so we got the mac and chees when we were almost done with our meal but onc i had a bite of that mac , mmmmmm mmmmmm <unk> mmmm <unk> we forgot all about the wait . it wa that good ! ! ! ! ! go tri the mac and chees . delici ! ! we also had the oyster , foie gra parfait , french onion soup , and my friend had the chicken , the gnocchi and filet mignon and they were all delici .
from what my friend tell me is thi place ha been around a long time . 15 year ago they renov but made the interior <unk> . it a confus mix of fish and chip and thai food . i had the fish and chip to go . they were pretti good . thi place need some seriou fresh <unk> <unk> to bring in new life and more custom . the dine room wa complet empti . there is a fridg in the dine room . im told they have a nice back patio in the summer though . avoid the dine room and just get take out or do the patio .

thi place is not worth the price . i heard a lot of great thing about thi place and wa highli disappoint . we were go to book a room here but the price were way too high for what you are get . we end up stay somewher els but visit circu circu for the adventur dome . it is overli crowd and <unk> trash . the carpet were onc red but are almost black now and there 's popcorn and trash everywher on the floor . the ride are outdat and the arcad game are extrem dirti . it 's sad to see what ha becom of thi place .
dr. <unk> himself is an <unk> doctor . he tell hi patient if you experi symptom to go to the hospit and contact hi offic . i follow hi direct and when i tri to follow up with him , hi schedul could care less and i wa told i could n't be seen for six month ! so six month after a trip to the <unk> for <unk> symptom for follow up is unreal .
my <unk> and i were plan on move in here and had gotten accept and paid a hold fee for an apart to be readi on <unk> . one week befor we were suppos to move in they said that the tenant were not move out and that they were go to take action legal . all they offer us wa a partial updat bigger floor plan for a about $ 50 more a month , and we decid that 's not what we want to do . the offic never answer their phone , we had mani question and call sever time and left sever <unk> never to be return unless we continu to call and someon actual answer the phone . a coupl day later they told us move in would be juli 20 , a day later they said end of juli like the 30th for sure , and then a day later they move the date to august 1st . we had more question so we call and everi front desk agent we talk to said that we need to talk to a manag and to call back at 11 on a tuesday . i call and they told me that the manag would be on break from <unk> ... a 3 hour break ? ! needl to say we did n't get a call back at <unk> so i call yet again . when i spoke to the manag she told me there wa noth they could do and she wa under the impress that we were inform inform by the other agent . manag 's bodi languag and tone of voic advoc that they do not care about their futur tenant . we decid to go elsewher . would never suggest live here . look at all the other review !
got my diamond ring <unk> to my finger . they did it for $ 40 . i went there just half an hour befor their close time . they were abl to do it for me . they actual took longer than their close hour but they went on just fine . the qualiti of work wa good too .
i love the <unk> ! ! thi hotel is top notch ! i ca n't wait to go stay there again . the room were so gorgeou and comfort . i stay in the resort king suit . the room wa realli classi and spaciou . the bathroom had hi and her sink with a gorgeou glass shower . the entir hotel wa beauti decor with <unk> butterfli and red accent . the locat wa realli conveni . you can walk across the street and go to the fashion show mall . you could also walk to the venetian pretti easili . there is a veri conveni locat bridg to the venetian next to a beauti <unk> . i had a fabul time there . i suggest thi hotel to anyon that want to have a relax time in a nice hotel in vega . it is simpli delight .

thi <unk> <unk> 's is right near my gym , so i go there often . the pro : - speed of servic : with a few except , they give you your food in under 5 minut , and if it 's not rush hour , often , under 2 minut - tast good ( obvious , a matter of prefer ) the con : - the cashier do n't speak english so well , so you often have to repeat yourself 2-3 time for them to understand what you want - they make mistak in my order about <unk> % of the time
i stumbl into thi book shop on one of the veri few <unk> day in arizona and i 'm so glad i did ! they had a first edit copi of my absolut favorit book , <unk> and <unk> , and so mani other great select of all differ <unk> that i purchas . the owner were incred nice and knew right away whether or not they had certain <unk> off the top of their head . and ... just like everyon els ha mention , the store is incred charm ... includ the cute littl cat roam the aisl , as if guard all the book . if you want to beef up your librari with vintag read , book of your past , or just <unk> <unk> ... i would highli recommend thi store . i plan on return back for all my futur book need .

<unk> wa a fantast server ! extrem attent and veri easi to talk to , had some great suggest and knew the menu thoroughli !
be realli care when you rent a car here , they will extra charg you anyth they can . i got a park ticket with the rental car and paid it coupl week later . the compani then went ahead and charg me doubl the ticket a month after the rent ? ! i call differ number and pass around becaus i did n't have rental agreement and proof of payment of the ticket with me , i thought everyth wa fine done and threw them away . they even charg me $ 2 for <unk> the rental agreement number ? ! such a scam and big wast of time . thi should be your last choic . <unk> : still do n't have my money back .
thi place ha had it up and down and now in true <unk> to the name of citi it 's in , it ha <unk> from the <unk> . when it first open thi place wa awesom : hentai play in the bar area and good spici tuna roll which were my favorit at the time . over time the restaur went downhil , the qualiti of the fish wa lower and overal it seem too overpr for what you got . the yellowtail <unk> wa probabl the onli thing that kept be good through it down <unk> . hentai on the <unk> wa replac with weird video effect that go with the music . now the place ha increas the qualiti of fish , they have fresh chop <unk> avail on request and a great select of cold sake . hentai is n't back but anim replac the video effect . i 'm happi to go to <unk> 32 again .
so i do n't expect a lot from fast food but two slice of pickl on my big mac and water down drink is just bad . terribl choic on my <unk> .
i 'm <unk> about thi spot ... the food is averag . the beer select is good . the locat is great . first , the food ... your run of the mill bar grub -- burger , hotdog , fri . you would think the chili would steal the show but it 's realli pretti bland and lack that <unk> or spice i enjoy in a good chili . next , the beer select ... lot of great , local choic on draft . 20 choic , to be exact . i like that they offer flight becaus i am <unk> and like to sampl lot ! lastli , the locat ... i love <unk> court . it remind me of a littl alley in europ . it 's realli an oasi right in the heart of <unk> charlott . the interior of <unk> is nice , too . lot of sleek wood . high top tabl and a few seat at the bar . it 's <unk> though , so if anyth is happen <unk> ( especi a <unk> game ) expect a pack hous . so , moral of thi stori is , i wish they 'd up their food game . i would be inclin to visit more if there wa someth i realli love and crave on the menu .
staff is rude . price are higher than averag . got ta wonder whi they are so concern about be paid with cash . they even charg less if you pay cash . i am not go back .
the burger are good and fresh howev it 's annoy to have to pick from a small or larg . love the hand squeez lemonad and <unk> milkshak . thi is a great place to take the fam ani night of the week .

<unk> la vega crown <unk> of the park . it ha nice basketbal court even ha a sand <unk> court plenti of area that have differ barbecu and event . it also ha a farmer market everi sunday morn start around 8 am and plenti of path to <unk> .
i made an account on yelp just to talk about my horribl experi at thi restaur . to begin , i order a banana chocol chip crepe . when i receiv it , i wa in <unk> of the small size . probabl the size of a <unk> dollar bill . as soon as i took a bit , i wa disgust . it tast like a <unk> soak in milk . after the 3rd bite , i found a hair and i knew i could n't choke down the poor excus of a crepe . when i call the waiter over to complain , he said `` well , to late now ! '' . when i final got to the manger he took it away and that wa it . i did not get my money back nor a replac . what ever happen to the custom is alway right ? 100 % would not recommend thi restaur .
my wife and i have been come to palio sinc the bellagio open . thi is a hidden littl gem tuck away within the bellagio back area near the pool entranc . when most guest want to eat breakfast or lunch they go to the `` buffet '' or the main breakfast restaur in the middl of the hotel . big <unk> to palio ! if you are a coffe fan and also enjoy homemad <unk> is the place for you . first the <unk> i am a huge starbuck bold roast fan . the onli coffe i have ever enjoy more wa actual in itali . that all chang upon our <unk> to palio . it is the onli coffe i like better than starbuck in the us ! you also get free refil . we often buy their whole bean coffe and take it home . their pastri 's rang from a standard blueberri muffin to a nutella croissant . everyth is mouth water . they even have some sugar free item . palio also serv small breakfast and lunch plate . for breakfast or lunch i highli recommend the <unk> with fruit and the yogurt parfait with fruit . the smoke salmon `` pie '' is awesom . overal , it is pricey but worth everi cent . there is no waiter servic . you order from the counter and either take the item out with you or eat at one of their beauti decor tabl in the restaur ( seat yourself ) .the line dure prime morn hour can get long but it move . if you are use to the standard vega <unk> palio . do n't be <unk> crazi and order some of the <unk> pastri 's or small plate . definit get a coffe and enjoy the best coffe in the us ( with starbuck a close second ) .
had famili in town thi weekend so i had to suffer the strip . went to bouchon for brunch . the place wa pack and i wa impress with the precis of the staff . i had <unk> hash . like everyth at bouchon , it wa perfectli respect . the <unk> wa tender but lack in tangi yummi . it also lack in potato and <unk> . the one thing that wa realli <unk> on thi trip wa when we order a side of fri the server ask if we would care to make them truffl fri for a `` small upcharg '' ? my bad for not ask how small . i think the fri were $ 5 and the upcharg wa an addit $ 13 . when question , the server remov the charg without hesit but the experi made me feel like a <unk> and left me with a bad overal experi of the place . just put the price on the menu if you 're that <unk> of your truffl fri .
i love cirqu perform . i watch world 's apart multipl time , and visit a coupl of show both at home and in vega . howev , i felt thi show wa a bit lack . do n't get me wrong , the show alon is a good show ... but compar to their other show , it just did n't stand out for me . it 's mostli danc ... i wa expect mostli an acrobat show full of wow ... but even the acrobat were mild in comparison to other <unk> show are fine and all , i do n't mind it . but their time wa off and almost sloppi dure thi particular perform ( peopl fall behind the rest of the group , peopl forget move , etc ) . i love the special effect and light ... i love all the audienc particip . the music wa great . there were laughabl moment . i did enjoy myself , but i feel the price wa n't worth it . there were about 3 or 4 perform i truli enjoy , the rest wa just kinda <unk> .
first of all , the `` perfect '' margarita wa not perfect . the appet were good , but not great . the crazi thing when we get the check at around <unk> it doe n't have the happi hour price of half off . when we ask if they were the correct price the waitress said ye that meant the margarita were $ 18 realli realli total not worth it and to top it off the hostess at the door said they do n't realli know the price . also seem like they were short staf and did n't have ani napkin my sister had to easi all-you-can-eat rib with onli one napkin ! sorri <unk> i realli love you but will not be return to your <unk> road locat . for spend well over $ 100 could have had a better experi somewher els .
food : 5 star , servic : 1 star . we head in , about 6pm on a saturday . the bar and the insid are pack , we 're look for a patio seat . we give the hostess our name and she quot us 45 minut for the patio , and tell her we are go to grab some drink . no drink price on the menu . while check out the menu , i ask a girl what the price of a drink is . she tell me she 's 18 so doe n't know , ask anoth server or the bartend . so i ask a server . he tell me he also doe n't know , ask the bartend . i ask the bartend , she doe n't know and ha to check their <unk> . <unk> and repeat for 2 drink . no one seem to know the price . if your wait staff doe n't know , just put it on the menu . whi the guess game ? no seat at the bar so we head outsid to at least enjoy the weather . to our surpris there are <unk> open tabl on the patio . whi a 45 minut wait ? ? ? we pick a tabl and sit down . the hostess come out and tell us we can sit there , but they are `` catch up on the tabl insid so ca n't wait on us '' - you have empti tabl on a saturday night . whi not just have enough wait staff to accommod ? it is saturday after all . you are a restaur in one of the busiest , <unk> restaur district in the citi . get it togeth . we finish our drink . <unk> minut later , a differ hostess come out and ask us if we need a server . we tell her ye . she hand us menu . we wait anoth <unk> minut , no one ha seen us and she come out to seat anoth tabl . `` ha your waitress seen you yet ? '' `` no , we do n't even have water . '' she send out the manag . we place our order . i ask if we can at least have a drink comp . sure . she walk away , forget to ask what we were drink ; come back out a coupl minut later to ask . the food wa delici . it 'll keep me come back , and i 'm sure that is the one and onli save grace of thi restaur and whi it 's still around .
ate here two night in a row as i wa stay at the hotel with a busi group . while a littl understaf servic wa friendli and beyond effici . the menu wa enjoy by all and i can whole <unk> recommend . ask for the bar menu to have even more choic .
i 'd love to give thi salon a better review . my tech , johnni , wa so nice and the owner made me <unk> the entir time i wa there as i overheard him talk . ala , i ca n't ! 3 star at most . first off , the salon is in <unk> need of a good clean . there is nail <unk> cover everyth , dirti <unk> ball on the <unk> good . i will say that in <unk> of thi i know he use sanit tool , and that they line their pedicur <unk> . the biggest compliment i have is that they have like a million gel color to choos from . i found the perfect color i had in mind , and i love it . the overal job ( simpl gel manicur ) is <unk> , but not awesom enough to overlook the <unk> and gener poor decor of the salon ( nail in the wall , old christma light , weird candi toy <unk> the <unk> , no ) .
immedi after my son instal new <unk> on my old toyota , i went to pep boy to have it <unk> . right after thi my car wa make a loud <unk> sound in the front end . after 4 day of the nois get progress wors , i wa afraid to drive the car . i took the car back into thi store and could have absolut been taken ! the employe and mechan are profession , kind , and most of all honest ! ! ! i wa sure they were go to tell me that the $ 400 <unk> were bad or that the instal wa wrong ... .it turn out to be a loos <unk> ! they thank me for my busi and sent me on my way ! i could not be happier with the servic at the lake <unk> store !
i had a seriou problem and <unk> <unk> made it painless . my entir fuel system need replac . it wa a complex problem and insur wa involv . from <unk> to <unk> the custom servic wa over the top . i receiv regular <unk> updat , great listen and awesom courtesi . my <unk> <unk> run like new .
honesti alert - i 've never made it past ice cream . i want to i do - seriou pizza lover right here - but when a small sugar cone is $ 3 , massiv and so creami and rich - you never get insid . pumpkin is my favorit but onli season so the cooki dough becom my go to ... and if you have the room they liter serv the world best banana split - they even ask how you want it - tradit or sub out flavor for the ice cream - do the tradit and thank me ( just after you thank them ) .
<unk> . i guess it 's inevit . i have to write a beauti bar review . <unk> ... here goe . i 'd just like to start out by say i realli have to give the <unk> kudo - they and the <unk> realli stuck out their neck ( and <unk> ) to <unk> ahead <unk> on fremont east befor it becam establish as the hipster haven it is becom / ha becom . for that alon , they earn my respect . a friend and i stop in earli one even when they first open - i rememb a well stock bar and <unk> tattoo bartend that were realli nice to boot ! sinc then i 've seen some terrif band there over the year both insid and outsid on the back patio , such as <unk> <unk> ( outsid in <unk> temp ) , andr william , variou <unk> rock bowl show , and the amaz <unk> perform to an audienc of five one night stuf into the space in one of the front window bay . that said , i seem to enjoy thi place less and less each and everi time i come . first off - it 's too freakin ' loud insid . whether there 's a band play or a dj spin record the sound level in thi place border on pain . there is such a thing as a comfort music level - even for loud rock and roll in a <unk> bar . i know , i know ... if it 's too loud , you 're too old - well , mayb i am . secondli - beer in a can ( <unk> ) . the beauti bar use to serv bottl beer ( that you would pour into a plastic cup to go out on the patio ) . i understand the safeti concern and the reason behind the plastic parti cup , but serious ? can you not have one decent light beer bottl or on tap ? noth bum me out more than beer in a can . for real . i realli want to love the <unk> - and i did n't mind it there for a while - but it seem to get more low budget and <unk> each and everi time i go . thi last time we went my friend ask for scotch - and they stare at her <unk> befor tell her they do n't have scotch . at a bar . kind of sad , when they have so much possibl to be a stellar venu .
walk into thi amaz establish wa took me to burger church and i wa have a moment . i did n't eat my burger right away but later that even that burger wa still equal delici , but my root bear float wa on point ! that ice cream wa fantast so much so that i wa tempt to have a second one , but <unk> myself becaus of all the attract peopl sit around me ! ca n't wait for my next trip to toronto for my next <unk> experi ! <unk> the burger !
i am <unk> by the crazi high rate for thi restaur . it is perfectli fine , but the select is fairli limit , and my trio signatur dish wa adequ but not special . servic wa a littl awkward - friendli enough , but <unk> . the waiter brought one diner 's salad befor her side dish , though she clearli order them togeth . then it wa a <unk> wait befor anyth els came out . thi is but one exampl of thing feel a littl off . worst of all , someth veri bad had happen in the ladi ' room that we felt compel to inform manag about . so mayb i just wa suffer from a lost appetit . fine , but i expect more .
veri friendli servic and the food is reason price and tast alright . we 've dine here sever time . we love mom and pop shop , but thi cafe is onli alright . there are a few place further about ( 10 minut away ) that have better food qualiti at the same price point . overal experi and ambienc is veri veri veri casual . mayb a littl too casual . everyth is serv in and on <unk> styrofoam . the space is <unk> with `` stuff '' . a littl more concern about present of their space and food would elev guest experi <unk> . if you 're in the neighborhood , short on time and would like some filipino food , and are not too concern about feel like you might be eat in some stranger 's slightli <unk> live room , then thi place will probabl satisfi you .
roll are n't that great , but the extens appet list is realli good . they offer a lot of stuff on the ayc appet list that other sushi place do n't , like the cod , yellowtail collar , smelt fish , kalbi , etc . if you want roll , there are better place to go .
pride in servic and the food wa amaz ! ! we have never had visit thi locat but it will now be one of my regular stop ! i wa veri impress with the whole experi . the food wa delici the portion were perfect and the servic wa excel . <unk> our server wa incred profession and veri attent . we were leav and 3 nice dress manag with big smile open the door to let us out and thank us for come in ! wow ! ! highli recommend !
great beer . great atmospher . great burger . great breakfast . order my burger cook medium and they actual cook it medium !
found our new <unk> addict . inexpens treat , onli downfal is no where to enjoy my <unk> there . <unk> is in a corner of a park lot , so we take our to a nearbi park or home to enjoy . mix and match their flavor or enjoy their menu . the staff is wonder and will mix whatev you want ! ! ! we 'll be back ! !
i need to start by say they never clean my carpet . i wish there wa a way to write a comment without leav an actual review or leav a star rate . sinc there is not thi is the onli way i have to express my <unk> . earlier thi week i got a <unk> in the mail advertis 3 room for $ <unk> . i realli just have two room that i feel need to be clean at the moment ( plu i wa go to have them do my stair but we never made it far enough to get to that ) but the <unk> say the max size of each room is 250 sqft . well each of my room is just over <unk> sqft ( about <unk> sqft total between the two ) so i call to ask if i could just have two room done for the price of the three and they told me `` no '' and that each room over 250 sqft count as two room so i would have to pay the price for four room . thi make zero sens to me sinc it would certainli be easier to clean two room ( especi sinc they are connect ) of just over 600 sqft than it would be to clean three separ room of the same squar <unk> . i do n't appreci the way they do busi so i would definit not recommend anyon call them .
my first time here i wa seat quickli sinc i came earli in the even . i purchas three groupon for $ 7 off per groupon . i chose the seafood miso hot pot and it wa beauti <unk> . i ask for an extra plate for <unk> , shrimp , and crab shell . it wa delici and the waiter wa abl to guid me through the <unk> sauc and answer my question .
<unk> buffet at caesar 's palac is an absolut must do when in la vega . seafood , meat , vegan , veggi , sweet , beverag , asian , american , italian , mexican , french , english ... if you can think of it , they got it ! the sunday brunch at $ <unk> is a bargain ! everyth is of the highest qualiti and in abund . you may grace the buffet for two hour . <unk> yourself , but be sure to sampl everyth . with that said take a quick tour befor plate load begin . have fun at each of the serv station . two of my fave are the noodl station and the seafood station , but bewar ... there is no stomach pump station ! lol ... you will definit want to let out your belt when you 're done or better yet , wear your <unk> belt ! thi is one day a year that you can live it up !

we were too full from a massiv lunch we ate to eat a real dinner , so we decid to eat dessert for dinner . we found thi place on yelp and head out . such a good decis . my <unk> <unk> mold mouss wa out of thi freak world , and husband and dad both realli enjoy their <unk> eclair . all three of us order larg glass of milk with our dessert , and , weird as it is , it wa some of the best milk ani of us had ever had . decad , beauti , delici treat <unk> .
whenev , wherev i my roam if there 's a portillo 's near i will find it and make time to go . thi locat , in my experi , wa <unk> to ani <unk> locat . they were pack - which is typic for these guy dure the lunch hour and were handl it with grace . to some thi it too slow , too <unk> , but to anyon who know these joint , know it 's part of the price you pay for the delici b , b , b , b , beef , the gravi , the chill and chicago dog , the italian combo , the chop salad the chocol cake . if you have never been here , man you got ta go and if you know portillo 's , it 's exactli what you know and love !
<unk> cafe is one of my favorit place to eat . though there are mani amaz dish here , my favorit is the pull pork sandwich . it is top with onion ring and is fantast ! . i discov thi restaur about 3 year ago when i wa work in the area . i have taken mani custom and friend there for lunch . it 's a real home cook meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food . the staff is courteou and rememb who you are . i think that 's import for busi . anyhow , <unk> get two thumb up from me !
my opinion about <unk> , the good press , and other juic bar that have <unk> up around the citi is a subpar <unk> + huge <unk> for the price . often they contain yogurt which is not exactli <unk> friendli and can be <unk> qualiti . <unk> also extrem expens ( over $ 10 for a <unk> bottl ) ? ? thi place is amaz ! it 's pure ingredi that they <unk> right in front of you and the price are probabl the best in the citi for juic . you pay $ 8.50 for 1 liter . it becaus thi is not a huge chain with the <unk> of max profit , but a realli friendli coupl who run an honest busi and will even pour the leftov in a littl cup for you to drink !
the crispi beef is a must have ! ! ! thi restaur is heavi in my rotat for deliveri ... . and the owner are nice and genuin . best thai joint that i 've found in mississauga .
i tri the <unk> <unk> <unk> cherri . it wa ok but noth i 'd come back for . i declin like them on facebook to save a dollar . i figur if they 're buy like i wa oblig to post an <unk> review . cute decor . conveni drive-thru due to open thi week . you can tri the product yourself and see if you 're more enthusiast . <unk> <unk> bowl is right up the street for comparison . when i recommend that to a friend she said it chang her life . joe 's should use their deep pocket to buy them out and sell it in their drive-through ! !
i went to thi place on it open time at <unk> and i have to say 2 thing , thi rate reflect that the servic is 5 star qualiti , . howev the food is <unk> star qualiti , henc the 2 star . we order their signatur noodl , a beef jerki appet , crispi chicken , and a brown sugar sticki rice . 40 minut later . we have the noodl which wa okay and averag , the extrem tini beef jerki appet for <unk> as shown in my pictur , which ha a tast of <unk> beef jerki . and we could n't ' wait ani longer for a crispi chicken and brown sugar sticki rice that just could n't arriv . the server did apolog <unk> and repeatedli henc the servic 5 star . howev we still never got the food , and by that time we pretti much just gave up and left . i have to say thi chain restaur from china which is rel popular ha not realli caught up to the hype . and also we tri to order one of the rice meal , howev we were inform none of them are readi to be order yet . so basic just disappoint all around unfortun . i ca n't realli recommend thi place to anyon as our experi wa not except . outsid of the server actual be nice and care , we ca n't give it a high rate caus most of the food could not even arriv , and the one that did arriv wa underwhelm
i shop at the glendal and <unk> <unk> store for produc onli . the store is fairli new so it is larg and clean , with a festiv ambianc ( veri loud music , and the occasion danc <unk> ) . the produc is fresh and the price are fantast . you can find thing here that you ca n't get elsewher , like mexican papaya , everi kind of chili pepper you can imagin , <unk> <unk> pad and other <unk> item . on wed and <unk> there are amaz sale and so the store get quit crowd , so go earli if you can . and be prepar to wait for awhil to check out . they also have a bakeri , they make tortilla in-hous and they have a salsa bar and a lunch counter with mexican food that i have n't tri , but smell veri good . differ locat may have differ qualiti of produc . i went to the locat on thoma and found great papaya but green banana , then that same day i went to the one on glendal and <unk> ave and found ripe banana but <unk> , <unk> papaya . i would not buy meat or fish here or anyth els for that matter . just produc . be awar , it 's all <unk> . better produc and way more charm than ani other supermarket .
damn great , old school servic , and , for my <unk> soul -- foie gra ! ! ! ( melt in my mouth ... could have die happi then and there ) wonder <unk> cocktail menu ( yeah , i happili knock back a few <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> , <unk> cook steak and i 'm still dream about that onion side w/ jalapeño pepper on top ... howev ... it would n't kill them to turn on a few more light ! dine room as dark as a cave ... i could bare see my succul <unk> ! ! ! did dig the film <unk> as ceil decor .
worst experi in a restaur ever . i still can not even believ what happen at the grill on <unk> . i dine with 3 friend on a warm even and decid to sit on the patio . hostess took us to our seat and when we were final greet by our waitress , she <unk> us for sit outsid . she had an attitud right from the <unk> , she clearli did not want to wait tabl outdoor . it wa our first time at the grill , so we had a lot of question about the menu , portion , etc to which our waitress answer . annoy , but answer . our drink arriv a littl delay , deliv by a bartend . we were the onli tabl outsid and there were few car in the lot , so we did n't imagin it would be busi . servic wa slow enough you would have expect a full hous . most of our food came out togeth , but of cours deliv by someon other than our waitress . in the <unk> between order and deliveri , the waitress never brought ani condiment , napkin , silverwar or anyth . the food came and we had to wait to eat it becaus of thi . my friend split a cheeseburg and there wa noth with it . no pickl , lettuc , tomato , onion ... so friend ask waitress for at least some pickl . waitress say <unk> <unk> you could have had some pickl if you 'd have ask for them ! ' . she arriv moment later with a plate of pickl <unk> . my companion have all start eat and are nearli finish , but my food ha not yet arriv . 6 lousi teriyaki wing . then all of a sudden , a short angri man come walk over with the wing and that 's when shit went down . he wa <unk> on about someth then said <unk> ha the wing ? ' when i repli he liter drop the plate in front of me and said <unk> 's your <unk> wing ' . our <unk> hit the tabl onc we realiz he wa not kid around . he ( the owner ! ) wa clearli upset over someth he thought we said about fat , bald greek men and wa scream and caus quit a <unk> . he told us he did n't need us make all that nois in hi restaur and he did n't want peopl like us in hi restaur . now he 's walk around our tabl like a circl <unk> , he is clearli out of hi <unk> mind . i am certainli not go to touch the food he brought and now my husband is mad so we ask for the check and get readi to leav . angri guy say `` get the fuck out . i own thi place , i have plenti of money and do n't need your . '' my girlfriend and i start walk out at thi point . other friend stop to ask the bartend for the check instead , but bartend just shake hi head and say <unk> said not to ... . ' husband ask peopl at the bar if we were be too loud and they all said `` no , he just goe off like that sometim '' . wait , so thi is normal ? and total accept ? i would normal offer a fair review and comment on the tast of the food , price , atmospher , etc . but in thi case , i could n't care less what the rest had to offer . the food tast like tear and bad busi and the place look like failur . not onli will i never again patron thi establish , i will go out of my way to tell peopl to never come here . i have never been so <unk> in all my life . still look for the zero star rate ...

super cheap eat here at pop up hous . we got a banana crepe with chocol and whip cream along with a milk bubbl tea for onli $ <unk> ! honestli i 'm so shock that they can keep price thi low ! ! ! the owner wa super nice and friendli and it wa onli a 5 minut wait for the set . the chocol on the crepe wa n't your standard nutella , but it tast like actual chocol . the crepe itself wa just ok though , but definit worth the money . there are mani other item on the menu well worth tri !
a friend took me here becaus she heard through friend that it wa good . it is good . the deer carpaccio is amaz , fresh meat well accompani with a special mayo sauc and balsam vinegar , and fri onion sprinkl on top , nice veri nice . the mackerel is nice too , surprisingli , i usual do n't like mackerel cuz it 's <unk> , but thi dish ha bacon bit in it and the sauc ha honey i think so the sweet add a nice touch . the gnocchi is so veri good , just as good as il <unk> , and that 's as good as it get . it 's made fresh , it 's soft and just melt in your mouth , the sauc is a bit creami but not rich , but smooth and well balanc . with a touch of parmesan and crush pepper and suddenli the last bite is up and you wonder how you inhal the whole thing so quickli ... the sear foie gra with balsam vinegar wa nice too . but we 're in montreal and foie gra is done well everywher ... thi one wa good but it doe n't stand out that 's all , but it wa veri good . at first glanc thi place remind me of au pie de <unk> , open kitchen eat bar concept . the ambianc is similar but the food is differ . all in all thi is wa a wonder surpris , on the strength of the mackerel , carpaccio and gnocchi . the price is decent about 130 $ tax tip includ for two , two entré , two main dish , two dessert and one glass of wine . thi and <unk> , are my new favorit restaur of 2010
i 've been here a few time now and i realli enjoy it . it 's got cheap eat , a nice vibe and good food .

solid frozen yogurt joint . got the pecan pie and chocol turtl flavor , and both were veri tasti . they also have dairi free pineappl and coconut <unk> . cost is $ <unk> , and they gave us a $ 2 militari discount . <unk> in the loyalti program with your cell phone , and get $ 5 off when you <unk> $ 50 point ( $ 1 = 1 point ) . glad thi place is open until 10pm for those warm summer night !

i 've live where there are four of these shop in the same strip mall ( seattl , <unk> ) and while <unk> 's is n't the best ever , the fact that it exist and is clean and tasti make me realli appreci it . i ca n't for the life of me understand whi anyon would order off the `` american '' menu ... .
<unk> friday is wack , it an all age pool and if your over 21 they just give you a <unk> band which mean you 'll be parti with kid and mostli creepi old <unk> men . sick .
the onli reason whi i 'm give them a one star is becaus i have to in order to leav them a review . let 's start with the posit . the hash hous ha a good breakfast , but it stop there . the hotel as a whole wa dirti . we stay on the <unk> floor and everi room we pass to get to our wa miss the number on there door . our carpet wa pull up and shred in our room , our sink would n't drain and left us forc to use water from the shower and you could hear the guest next door breath . after check out we went to hash hous and then sat in the lobbi while we wait for an uber . the secur guard <unk> my fiancé of `` sleep '' in the lobbi just becaus hi hat wa low to help with the bright of the light . it 's vega , hangov are to be expect . we got up and sat outsid to wait for an uber . the secur guard approach us again and proceed to tell us we need to go . i let him know that we stay here for two night , spend plenti of money at their casino and their dine . he walk back insid and came out with two more secur guard . i proceed to inform them of what happen and they were slightli more reason . the first secur guard continu to talk under hi breath . if thi is how they treat their guest then i have noth els to say . want respect , a clean room and basic <unk> upon arriv ? then do n't stay here !
my second time here and the <unk> wa just as good ! love the atmospher here and the staff are all wonder . dure our first visit i had the <unk> complet meal with caesar salad , fri as my side and the chocol orang mouss . i chose the mushroom sauc for my steak but did n't like it . everyth els wa perfect . the boy had the prime rib platter and he ate everi last bite . thi time around we went with a larger group . i had the chicken marsala with mash potato , veri tasti . the sauc make it . two peopl order steak and the other two had burger ( burger were huge ! ) . everyon enjoy their meal and said they would come back . i love that they give you warm bread to start . and their <unk> <unk> are the best i 've ever had ! i had the creme <unk> and it too wa one of the best ! the size is doubl what you 'd get anywher els and so delici ! cold , smooth creami custard with a warm crunchi sugar crust . mmm !
nice environ and fast and friendli servic , with a nice menu . close to bell centr .
date , pool hour are short and ridicul , would be nice to sit around a nice relax pool bar after the <unk> degre weather and after 7pm . as a hilton honor diamond ? not impress , noth special ! paint peel in bathroom , sad casino experi compar to the other surround it . no execut loung or <unk> will look elsewher next time . hilton <unk> ? step up your game and treat your loyalti member better .
well , what can i say . fleme is a chain steakhous , but they do tri hard . sometim a bit too hard . you know you 're at a chain from the qualiti of servic . do n't get me wrong , the servic is veri nice most of the time , but it 's clear they do <unk> train <unk> cater to midwestern diner and the whole thing come off a bit like <unk> friday . onc in awhil server there are not the friendliest ; they seem to have a hard time take a moder line of just be courteou and effici . most of the time howev , the servic is <unk> . at least they do n't wear <unk> , like at <unk> 's chri on the west side . so ye , if you 're in madison and you like <unk> ( if corpor ) steakhous , whi not ?
i like the theater more than the movi i saw lol . great ambianc , great servic , veri knowledg ticket <unk> guy . great crowd . excel experi overal there .

oh <unk> <unk> <unk> mi <unk> <unk> <unk> ? english translat : oh my love , whi have you kept me wait ? gelato ha come to me ! oh and with so mani differ flavor of chocol ! how can i decid my love ? you tempt me ! snap out of it ! ok well we went in there just at close time which i thought wa <unk> pm but my boyfriend notic the door said 9:30 pm but it wa too late , i wa alreadi `` in the zone '' and look over the mani chocol flavor combin of gelato . with my eye glaze over , i ask the ladi behind the counter for a few tast sampl so i could make my most difficult decis of the day , which chocol flavor do i want ? when i ask for the third tast , she inform me that you onli get two tast sampl . what ? you have thi beauti store with these fabul gelato and you lay out thi beauti and tempt display and you onli get two sampl ? realli ? i wa abl to get anoth tast sampl out of her but it wa clear she wa tire and they want us to hurri up with our select so they could close . i still did n't understand her attitud as i did n't notic the time chang of close at 9:30 pm . so i guess i can understand her attitud , know that now . howev , it seem to me that if you decid to accept serv a custom then allow them to complet their purchas in the normal manner . we took our select to go , so it 's not like we were stay insid the restaur at close . what about the gelato ? ? ? ? ok so let 's get down to the real reason for our visit . we share <unk> a divers to my <unk> chocol <unk> . wonder pistachio , you can tast the fresh nut in the mix . we both got medium size gelato with two flavor to sampl . i order the <unk> chocol and you can tast and feel mani textur in your mouth with the shred coconut and chunk of dark chocol . on top of that , i use my third sampl tast which wa <unk> road and that one had the marshmallow and chocol swirl into the mix . both flavor were veri rich , thick , creami and fill . it wa so satisfi . i know that next time , howev i will get a small cup as it is more fill than ordinari ice cream , to me and it is so decad . there wa n't time to get the owner 's stori or about their gelato or how much sugar and <unk> they use in their recip . next time i visit i will look into that . howev on the whole , if you have to ask , you probabl do n't need to be eat it anyway . just enjoy the wonder tast experi and the beauti , modern store . it is locat in <unk> park between wendi 's and <unk> 's and in the same build as <unk> 's fish taco and jason 's deli . save some room for desert !
we play the <unk> tonight . bartend wa <unk> friendli and cool . decent stage for a small venu . no drink special for band though . the onli reason whi thi get 3 star is becaus the `` <unk> '' realli suck . so much feedback , not a good mix and a pretti solid `` i do n't give a fuck attitud . ''

( roast banana ice cream , milk chocol <unk> <unk> and chocol fondu ) it wa even <unk> as savor pittsburgh 's dish of the year for 2013 . it wa amaz ! servic wa superb the entir even . i also like the fact that you can make reserv right from the savoy websit which are a must as the space onli seat about 75 peopl . all in all savoy is a nice place that i would visit for sure for drink dure happi hour and go somewher els for dinner . i just can not with a clear <unk> justifi the price without a groupon deal .
i came to yelp when we discov termit <unk> , i also had 3 other quot and did some research with the <unk> , also compar yelp review with other compani ... and like everyon ha said - we had fast and friendli servic ! and veri afford ! i had hope for a longer warranti - and get around that by pay an annual fee - but the lower price up front help justifi the annual fee you pay to keep up the warranti . at the veri least i would have hope for a 3 year warranti . but i suppos they would increas their price to cover that cost , sinc most other compani offer <unk> year warranti .
a good stay downtown our stay here wa conveni to the citi and the hotel wa well manag and <unk> . i think the charact of thi hotel chang when the <unk> team is in town for a game . with the team on a road trip away from town , our stay wa pleasant at the <unk> . note : the park <unk> wa a surpris , i would have prefer a more <unk> <unk> on the <unk> websit .
need to go to mass in downtown ? thi is realli your onli option unless you have the time to cross a bridg and go into a surround neighborhood . not my favorit place for church but it 'll do in a pinch . http : <unk> % <unk> % <unk> % <unk> % <unk> % <unk> st. mari of merci , downtown pittsburgh st. mari of merci wa found in <unk> . two year prior to that a hous wa purchas in septemb <unk> and convert as a <unk> call our ladi of <unk> for the irish resid of the point area . at first thi <unk> serv as a mission for st. <unk> <unk> , but in <unk> st. mari wa form as an <unk> <unk> . thi build soon becam <unk> for the grow <unk> . on may 12 , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> church on the corner of third <unk> and ferri street wa purchas by the <unk> . after renov , the church wa dedic on septemb 24 , <unk> and <unk> st. mari of merci . even thi church prove <unk> , so in <unk> a new church wa built and dedic on may 28 , <unk> on the site of the current church . for <unk> year , thi church serv the <unk> well . howev , by the earli <unk> 's , structur damag and the small size of the build <unk> the build of a new church . the last mass in thi church wa held on may 22 , <unk> . the church wa then <unk> and the current build construct at the same locat . on octob 25 , <unk> , the exist st. mari of merci , locat at the corner of <unk> street and the <unk> of the <unk> wa dedic . thi church is still in use today .
huge portion of <unk> , love that it 's serv with sea weed . the udon is simpl but delici ( veri on par with someth you 'd find in tokyo ) and sooo cheap . the green tea cheesecak is disappoint . instead of dessert just get anoth meat or ramen dish tbh . veri casual simpl dine space but with servic and everyth .
my typic drink : <unk> <unk> ice tea <unk> <unk> coffe -the <unk> john blend drink <unk> john 's is what a coffe shop should be . the coffe & tea is fantast , amen are veri invit , and the staff is veri friendli . <unk> & jj are commun orient , passion about the bean , and just overal great guy ... whi would n't you support them ?
<unk> 's happen to be a few door down from my busi ... veri danger ! ! liter , everyth is so good . they bake their bread fresh everyday and it melt in your mouth . lunch - i suggest a sandwich on their french bread . i person love their hot chicken sandwich with <unk> dress , melt chees and season chicken , grill onion ... need i go on - <unk> i 'm hungri . or the greek salad with slice chicken ... <unk> thi is where you eat the <unk> bread . now when you 're diet and not allow carb - just eat the top & save your <unk> calori for the chicken marsala with penn pasta . do n't forget dessert - the <unk> . enjoy
i am veri glad thi place is close by and deliv good chines food . most of the asian restaur in n scottsdal are chain and they suck so it 's nice to have a local . they even do <unk> noodl which is one of my favorit and they do it well . i wish they did n't upcharg for brown rice though . it 's a regular event for me especi if i feel like stay in and just have some comfort chines .
how the hell is thi place so pack ? i guess it 's the onli `` sport bar '' around . <unk> central . lot of tv , complet averag food with water down beer . terribl tap select . they do offer pitcher , but i liter drank 1/2 a pitcher myself and bare even got a buzz . usual it take half a beer to do that . way overpr drink and food . whi do peopl come here ?
rachel 's is down the street from our offic , so we go there often . but late the qualiti ha been go down . i order a turkey avocado sandwich , but they forgot the avocado . it wa even written on the box and still miss it . the last two time we order carri out , there wa littl more than a hand of fri in the box . i thought the first time wa a <unk> . but it wa the same the second time for me . everyon in the offic also had bare enough fri to cover the bottom of the box . next time we decid to order take out , i 'll recommend other place .
great place ! ! do supper befor the hockey game and decid to stop in base on previou review . we were n't disappoint . the burger were delici , the fri were awesom and our server alex wa a delight . and it wa happi hour for drink ... . bonu ! ! !

the item here sold out quick ! the line is no where near as bad as the neighbor uncl <unk> but there is still some wait time . the icecream is also somewhat pricey but the qualiti is realli good . the place is small insid but it is mostli cater toward for peopl to order to go . overal , it is a nice addit to the <unk> yong area for dessert and icecream lover .
i thought i had written a review for <unk> ... . great food , great servic , great everyth ! love it so much had my wed recept here ... need i say more ? lol

( think of dog the <unk> <unk> , hi love wife <unk> , ani <unk> <unk> <unk> member , and the tour <unk> of bon cop , bad cop . ) downtown <unk> tend to be a lot more <unk> . out here on the <unk> , no so much . some of the appeal might be the weekend wine deal ? ( liquor store cost plu $ 5 per bottl ) . so enough <unk> . the food wa realli good . the french fri were excel ( and thi is perhap the <unk> <unk> frite crowd in the world outsid of <unk> ) . i had a carrot cheddar soup that sound weird but wa weird in a delici way ... and the burger wa realli , realli excel -- thick , juici and a perfect 10 .
i love their dinner b for two ! you get at least four meal out of it for 30 dollar . tri use lemon sauc instead of pineappl sauc on the pork so good ! <unk> won ton soup is realli good too .
excel select with a nice present . veri tasti food and pretti good atmospher .
i usual would n't wrote a review for a chain , but thi place is n't too bad , they have yet to get my order wrong which let be honest happen pretti often . friendli servic just wish the drive threw would be <unk> , from <unk> to 9:30 it 's like a park lot .
these day good custom servic is hard to come by , much less great custom servic . i need to replac the <unk> in my <unk> project tv . the servic man i spoke to ask me to bring it in & he would test it to make sure that wa the right part i need . he could tell by look at it , & so could i , that it wa blown . he replac the <unk> into the hous at no charg . i had no idea how to do that . he even play with my cri babi , which made him a happi babi . magic touch all the way around . thank so much chuck repair .
my fiancé and i did n't even get a chanc to eat here ... after walk in at around <unk> on a weeknight , we wait 10 minut befor we were even greet by a waitress . when she final approach us , she said a huge crowd just came in , so the wait would be veri veri long . i point out a tabl for two that wa open in the corner of the restaur and she <unk> said we could sit there and that she would be by in a few minut to wipe the tabl down . after anoth 20 minut of wait patient , the manag came to our tabl to tell us to move seat so anoth custom could squeez into the alreadi tight space . she made no comment or effort regard our filthi tabl , or the fact that we did n't even have a menu . at that point , we decid to leav the restaur and take our busi elsewher . we will not be return .
miso ramen on point . ca n't wait to go back . servic wa equal as good . great atmospher .
i am current in la vega for a dj convent , and wa look for a simpl , chill restaur that had wonder servic , welcom host , and amaz food . fuku burger deliv all thi and more , with the <unk> be a <unk> joint that spoke volum to my <unk> <unk> soul . walk in , the wall are decor with <unk> japanes <unk> that are reminisc of <unk> <unk> 's `` <unk> lover '' <unk> . the menu wa simpl to read , understand , and to select food from . the <unk> burger with mushroom and pickl red ginger wa juici with the right amount of tangi crunch -- and gone quickli , as it wa excel . the fri with the accompani of their <unk> `` crack '' sauc and sweet ketchup were perfectli season and i could n't get enough of them . abov all thi , the staff , led by <unk> and <unk> , were wonder to chat with and made sure thi midwestern man wa welcom . and , i wa . i love restaur that focu on keep it simpl , and thi one made me feel right at home . i highli recommend fuku to anyon , and i hope mani will spring up in chicago and <unk> . thank you for a wonder experi !

thi is one of the nicest <unk> i have ever visit . on a trip back from red rock canyon , w stop here for some food for dinner and breakfast the next day . i wa veri pleasantli surpris by the qualiti and select in thi store . thi locat is quit spaciou and well laid out . the folk work there were all friendli and help . will i be back ? the next time i go to red rock i will .
the <unk> room have been complet ! multipl shower stall avail . the onli thing miss is a <unk> water <unk> ( but thi is just a <unk> request as i swim here multipl time dure the week ) .
check out noodl about a year ago after a famili member wa rave about it . we went in for dinner on a friday night . somewhat of a line but the tabl seem to empti out fast and the staff wa quick to clean and readi the tabl for the next custom . our group order famili style and it <unk> wa an awesom mix of asian dish . ever sinc then i think everytim i am in vega around the bellagio i have taken a trip to noodl . most recent i got there dure lunch and they had multipl dim sum cart with a varieti of food to delight ani <unk> . dont forget that thi place is open till <unk> which make it a great drunk treat for ani vega night ! must tri !
<unk> hangout ( not as cool as the origin one in downtown phoenix ) serv creativ <unk> cuisin ( not as togeth as the origin one in downtown phoenix ) flavor mix of mexico , china , japan & <unk> , great craft cocktail on a menu that constantli chang . ( not as cool as the origin one in downtown phoenix - more of a main stream american white bread crowd here ) ... make sure the dish are well pace and warm ... ( never an issu at the origin one in downtown phoenix ) . the crew make great effort to make thing good and right , so hat off for that , but i definit will not think twice is i need to chose between thi locat of the <unk> in phoenix .
i went here today for dim sum and i love it ! the dim sum order style may be outsid your comfort zone if you 're not use to it . you order food as you see them come around on cart , flag down worker and pick howev mani dish you want from the cart . they will mark down the type of dish you got , which will add to your total . differ cart have differ item , but the same cart will come around quit often . it 's a great way to eat with your eye , pick food that look good and they tast good too ! highli recommend the deep fri squid <unk> , a light crunch on the outsid but soft and moist squid on the insid !
poor manag , the food wa n't what i expect . the onli thing that kept us there wa the select of tabl and our server wa super sweet . for the life of me ca n't rememb her name but she wa from the <unk> ! i wo n't be go back .
so after a bad experi a few year ago ... we came back . new manag new menu ! better experi ! new fan !

i have been here with my kid to do pedicur . the staff is real friendli and they do a good job and i never feel like they are rush . my last pedi last for 4 week - pretti good !
much better experi thi go round . bartend wa attent yet not hover to much . i had one of their salad with chicken and it wa good . we also had the three amigo <unk> , salsa , chees dip with chip . pretti good although i wish one of them had some heat . friend had a chicken rice bowl and said it wa realli good . beer special -- $ 2.75 for certain bottl beer . will return and tri their taco next time . also seem to have a decent select of beer on tap ( not realli a beer drinker person ) and i note a nice select of tequila .
the employe here are veri friendli . we were greet as soon as we walk in the store . as they look over the item we want to sell we got to look around the store . the store wa veri organ and clean . the cloth were easi to look through and all the size were label . some of the item were still on the expens side but better than buy them full price at a regular store . i will definit be come back here .
my favorit cours . great peopl . great food . anyon give thi less than <unk> is crazi .
thi place is great for lamb lover like me . so mani differ type of lamb dish , most of them delici . we order a few dish , all contain lamb . the one that i rememb : <unk> soup : i did n't like thi one actual . seem like they ad some flavor to tri to mask the <unk> , but i did n't realli like that flavor . when i order a lamb product , i want the <unk> ! <unk> dumpl were excel . <unk> the best that i 've had <unk> a lamb noodl dish that wa the special of the day . thi wa also realli good . probabl our favorit dish of the night <unk> away from the lamb chop ! they were realli salti , and also a lot of fat piec ( in fact , there wa more fat than meat ) <unk> lamb on <unk> wa delici as expect will definit be back . would have been 5 star if not for the fatti lamb chop
my wife and i like thi place and it 's 1 of our 2 go-to place for asian food in the area . thi one often win out becaus of the option for sushi under the same roof . the chines dish are n't anyth all that special , pretti standard stock for ani chines place . same for the sushi , but price is right and it 's good and conveni locat when out to grab <unk> plu run errand .
there 's so mani extens review alreadi i do n't need to write anoth , just want to add that thi is my favorit place to eat in all of la vega ! you might wait a while to get in but it 's worth it . do n't miss the filet slider or infus vodka martini , but do n't tri to stand up too quickli after more than one !
<unk> , so few review . i hope i 'm not give away a top secret place , but here goe . i wa here with my <unk> for a birthday parti the other day . i decid i would hang around while he enjoy himself . young folk , older folk , parti , just all type of peopl have a good time . as the other review note , everyth wa taken care of , appropri weight ball , bumper up , extra time , plenti of direct for everybodi . veri friendli and well attend by their staff . while i wa wait , i check out the snack bar . nacho and chees with a coke cost me onli 4 buck . standard bowl alley type food . highli recommend thi place !
<unk> is a great choic for italian . locat next to fri on <unk> and ray . we frequent takeout more often then <unk> . they have reserv space and a special door for takeout which make it veri <unk> . if you dine in it is casual and veri hip . well decor , trendi light , lot of tabl , booth and a bar area to the left . look for coupon in the wednesday mail . <unk> , the price are veri reason . complimentari <unk> bread and oliv oil is a great start . my <unk> wife like the <unk> menu . the <unk> menu is an assort of differ dish and your choic of meat . the roast asparagu salad with chicken is a favorit . the kid calzon are amaz and enorm . the choic for kid is pepperoni or chees . the adult calzon is enorm and wonder as well they have a special which ha pepperoni mushroom and sausag . big enough for two meal . if you get takeout ask for extra marinara for the calzon . also with takeout complimentari bread is provid which is a nice touch . they even have a small contain for the oliv oil balsam dip sauc . i have alway found servic to be friendli and quick . last night we had emili <unk> as our server . she wa great . attent and veri help .
just walk in off the street co my brother want to watch the hockey game . great servic , good food , at the time i wa there ( saturday night ) , there wa no music ( might have been co of the hockey ) so we could have a convers and not be drown out by nois . the food is pub fare and is good . good select of beer too . i 'd <unk> come again and i 'd recommend .
we stay here octob 21 <unk> . we book thi hotel for their awesom pool area . when we got there the pool area wa close for the season . they told me they close it <unk> 1st becaus they are not a tourist hotel . they are mainli a <unk> confer hotel . i talk to reserv three time for thi reserv and at no time did they tell me their pool area would be close . the hotel on the strip were still open . we paid almost full rate becaus we want to use their pool area . we could 've been comp our full 5 day at a differ hotel ( wynn and pari ) . do n't stay at thi hotel if you 're `` just a tourist '' . doe n't make ani differ that we gambl probabl more than a <unk> .
i do n't usual care much for the servic at earl 's - i find it is quit slow and the server do n't <unk> as well as at other restaur . howev , the pecan chicken <unk> salad ( on the featur menu ) keep me come back . although i do n't order it with the chicken , it is a fill and flavour salad . i find myself crave it at least 3 time a week . i know ! crazi ! ! ! i even plan <unk> with peopl i do n't want to see so i have an excus to eat thi salad . love it ! !
i did n't have their famou burger , but my carn asada burrito wa veri tasti . it wa busi at lunch , which tell you a lot about the place : peopl like it . you wo n't be disappoint .
so 3 star for a restaur in a ga station ? have you lost your mind pea ? look go eat there , if you know jamaican food made by jamaican you will give it 3 star too . i wa so good i had to call them up and tell them so . <unk> sweat tasti jerk with rice and pea ( jamaican for red bean and rice ) you need to tri thi place out . next time it 's oxtail for me . and sometim i heard they have brown stew . ask when your there . ani way ... <unk> to 3 star other visit did n't hold up
do n't go here ... it 's not even worth the time or effort to say whi , but yelp want me to add more word ... . aw ... <unk> about the place . one beer and we left . 30 minut of my life i 'll never get back .
thi place is good . howev , i order the chicken pho and they obvious put turkey meat in there . not complain , it wa good turkey meat .
thi is one of the best jamaican restaur in charlott hand down . the cabbag is amaz . nice atmospher
thi is my first review , but my experi wa sooo disappoint that i could n't hold myself to not to write thi . it is my first time at <unk> and i came to thi place after i had dinner on my first date anniversari and they manag to ruin the whole joy of the night . i order a <unk> bubbl tea with `` light sweet '' ( as they call it on the menu ) . sinc i dislik <unk> stuff , i am veri <unk> to have my drink lightli <unk> . after get the order and have a sip , sinc it wa too sweet , i ask one of the employe to chang it and she refus to do so . she said the syrup are alreadi sweet and that is whi the whole thing wa too sweet . so watch out if you have <unk> caus you their <unk> tea would give you a sugar rush ! i ask for the manag and they just consult with somebodi behind the wall and got back to me that no they ca n't chang the drink . consid that i onli had a sip and consid the cheap price of a <unk> it is such a disappoint that they made a big deal out of it . i am not gon na even <unk> on their attitud as that wa anoth stori for itself . thi wa definit my last visit .
great servic even befor close . we ate outsid . the food wa great . for appet had the thai crab cake . it wa veri good . husband had the coffe to drink and said it wa the best he had ever had . i had their chicken and he had their scallop and shrimp . the scallop were a bit <unk> , but everyth els tast great . great for a romant dinner or a busi meet ( there wa a meet go on besid us ) .
a ta mi sushi wa amaz ! my boyfriend and i were search for a veri close sushi place that also offer other cuisin option , sinc he is not a sushi fan . thi place ha it all and it is veri afford ! i had a miso soup , spici tuna , and the `` mexican roll '' ( superb ) and he had the orang chicken <unk> meal and we paid $ 30 and were stuf ! i am happi that i found a sushi place that i can go to with my boyfriend - who hate sushi !
we got marri in <unk> and came to <unk> for our 1 year anniversari . staff veri friendli and call us by first name the whole time we were there . jerk chicken wa amaz ! cash onli ! will be back .
thi place wa so delici ! i had the chees plate , <unk> <unk> tea , and a fruit bowl . my friend and i felt like indulg and got the nutella bomb dome as dessert and it wa extrem amaz .
thi is the best bbq place i 've been to yet ! the season on the chicken wa <unk> sweet , but not over sweet and definit not salti like other place i 've been to . the rib were tender and sauc wa delici ! the pull pork had so much flavor and in my opinion did n't even need anyth els ad to it . so so good ! my famili will be back here for sure !
i like uncl sam 's . i went to colleg in the area and now work in oakland so i have been a frequent custom over the past decad or so . let 's start with the extra . their fri are amaz but so oili i often feel like i 'm <unk> an <unk> as i eat them but they are so good i <unk> it 's ok to have them onc in a while ( as long as you split an order ) . they also have a fri onion thing that is kind of like an onion ring , onli not ring shape , they are also veri good . beer select : i am unsur if the oakland uncl sam 's ha beer . i live in the <unk> area so we usual go to the <unk> us for dinner ( aka beer time ) . their beer select is pretti good consid it 's a sandwich shop not a bar . we usual split a six pack for our group of 4 and the price is reason as well . sub : i usual get the chees steak with onion and pepper . i think it 's pretti good . they cook them right there in front of you so at least it is freshli made . i have found that if you go here dure lunch or dinner more often than not they burn your steak . thi is a recent develop and onli happen at the oakland locat . thi is the onli reason i 'm give thi review 3 star instead of 4 . i like a hot dog char but not a chees steak . the bread here is realli good . i think it is <unk> 's but i 've never ask . i wa a vegetarian for mani mani year but have never tri one of us veggi sub . they cook their veggi and their meat on the same surfac so if you are a strict vegetarian who doe n't want your veggi <unk> by cook on the same surfac as meat thi is not the place for you . i just do n't understand thi becaus they have a ton of vegetarian option that all sound great but then they cook them on a meat cook surfac . so bewar if you want a truli vegetarian meal ! park : park is mostli street park . there is a park garag not far from here but the price to park in the garag is a bit steep and dure work hour it can be hard to find a spot in the garag to begin with ! your best bet is street park but if you ca n't <unk> park you 're pretti much out of luck . there is n't much space to die in so you 're better off get your meal to go and walk over the <unk> plaza and get a tabl and have your lunch out of door . i say it 's worth a trip but not a trip out of your way !
if you 're look for an amaz full servic salon , do yourself a favor and give <unk> a tri . i 've never had a bad experi there . my most recent appoint wa for <unk> with <unk> . she is highli knowledg and took great care to find out exactli what i wa look . the end result wa perfect . both she and her assist are friendli and work effici . <unk> salon is an experi . treat yourself !
locat : veri access by subway . about 5-10 minut walk from <unk> station . price : drink are all around $ <unk> each . food : my most person favourit at thi place is the milk foam ! it 's a uniqu combin of sweet and salti ( strang , but delici ! ) i did n't realiz the magic tast of salt <unk> until i find thi place ! the foam is slightli heavi so it goe well with a light , slightli sweet drink . the <unk> tea with milk foam wa amaz ! i wa slightli <unk> about veggi in my drink but i 'm sold ! seat : they have about 3 huge tabl so it 's good for huge group . they also have free wifi so peopl sometim sit and studi . overal : nice place for <unk> tea and <unk> group !
thi place is awesom . it 's larg so the wait on the weekend is n't bad . menu is divers and the food is delici . total recommend the <unk> <unk> .
cute interior , tasti jerk chicken . thi small littl restaur serv up big portion of hearti caribbean food with veri friendli servic . my onli <unk> thing wa that the chicken , while tasti , did have a littl too much salt for my tast .
thi weekend stop on our pick a spot . the decor of thi place is nice , just what you would expect from a nice bar . wood bar , warm environ , lot of tv 's , <unk> art up on the wall ... the <unk> . that be said my wife and i order an appet , a meal each , and some wing ( the menu lead you to believ that these thing are to die for ) . just for those who will go there in the futur , there are other way to do nacho besid throw a bunch of chip on a plate then <unk> onion , oliv , jalapeño , and chees all over them . if your go to featur someth and suggest it to new <unk> to your restaur , you may want to make it someth <unk> . the meal were just straight bland . my wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich ( which it wa nice to see it wa a butterfli piec of chicken breast , i.e . fresh ) and i had there <unk> ( panini ) . my wife 's ' food wa fine , noth special . the onli problem wa that the coleslaw wa so wet that it wa drip <unk> <unk> onto the bun , the bread , everyth . unfortun mine wa as well . wet , soggi italian bread soak in liquid mayo ... enough said . the wing were just wing . fri , sauc , and serv . if your look for someth differ from a bar , you wo n't find it here . run of the mill bar . oh and lastli , for a bar ... or tavern ... 5 beer on tap and onli one beer that wa from the local breweri ? you would think there would be more in that <unk> .
t bone ! anoth <unk> that i 've been visit for about 10 year . i 'm go keep thi short and sweet . let 's start with the good : great place for eat anytim of the day as it 's 24/7 . the cashier there is veri friendli and funni . food qualiti is good and the portion is decent . <unk> ha alway been good with consist . steak are great . i can not speak about the burger becaus i alway get a steak there . now , onto the bad . not so much bad but here goe : onli had one bad experi with steak there . i order a rare steak and i could n't eat it . i do n't know if it 's the type of steak but it wa gross . so i onli eat medium rare <unk> place like keg or red lobster i 'll take a rare steak . price increas of the steak special from <unk> to 16 or <unk> ! realli ? ? ? one special will not fill me up so i do n't go there as much as i use to becaus of the price increas . t bone is a good place to chill and have a good steak and fri or mash potato . <unk> due to the price increas here is a pic of the 32 oz combo and 16 oz combo thank <unk>
we tri the spici <unk> tartar , roast bone marrow , <unk> and grit , pork belli with <unk> and <unk> mushroom , and tongu on brioch . thi <unk> will <unk> ani <unk> foodi 's tast bud . the flavor and pair of the <unk> fresh ingredi is so unexpectedli delici . each dish kept tast better , and as full as we all were , we pray the meal would not end . moder price for a gourmet experi with no frill . our spici <unk> tartar did n't have an overpow acid tast as most tartar do . in fact , the meat wa fresh , light , and tender . roast bone marrow wa <unk> than homemad butter and with top with sea salt , the flavor could n't have been more danger orgasm . ( honestli i would 've suck the bone dri , but it might 've been a tad <unk> . especi after just describ it as orgasm . ) pork belli ... well , need i say more after the word `` pork '' and belli ? '' the piec of meat wa cook precis to heaven and melt as soon as i bit into it . final , the tongu brioch . grow up in new york citi in a <unk> <unk> , italian , and irish neighborhood , i know good tongu <unk> . and <unk> <unk> doe black <unk> know good tongu ! the kitchen is wide open like a bar so you can see and smell your dish be cook and plate . the select of beer are mostli canadian with an except of a few import american choic ( i.e . <unk> dead guy ) . interest array of mix cocktail as well for those interest in still spirit . tip : do n't ask to split check as it rub the server the wrong way , be readi to order sever dish with tast portion , the menu is alter often so you may not get what i 've list , and do n't be <unk> by how weird the dish may sound . so to black <unk> : <unk> on have the best restaur , dare i say , in canada . continu creat outstand dish , <unk> ?
<unk> pm on friday befor the indian game . full hous . garag door window all the way around the place . beauti day outsid . manag ha the window all close becaus `` the air condit is on '' . just about as dumb as you can get . <unk> edit after the respons of the restaur 's manag : first , it is good to know that manag is read these review ( and respond ) . i hope it make for a better experi for diner . it is difficult , at best , to figur out how close the window on a nice day solv a problem with the air condit . speak without <unk> , it wa at least as nice outsid the restaur as it wa insid . and sit on the other side of the bar , which wa open , is a magnific idea . too bad that we were first told that `` it wa n't open yet '' and the hostess offer to let us know when it wa while we wait at the bar , which we did . eventu , we gave up and move to a tabl so we could eat after again be told it wa n't open . minut later , we watch dozen of peopl move to the cool , comfort and enjoy side of the restaur while we wait for our food . no hostess or wait staff offer to help us move . we were certainli past the point of care by then . there were four `` hostess '' and clearli not one had a clue . it 's not a horribl place by ani stretch ( my hamburg wa veri good ) but thi kind of silli is a <unk> .
out of all the chirashi i 've tri in toronto so far , thi place doe it best . they say you can judg a sushi chef 's skill by tast the <unk> ; i can not say that i have ever enjoy eat <unk> until i had it at <unk> . their chirashi wa perfectli put togeth and the differ type of fish they use provid a perfect balanc of clean flavour and fantast textur . i would definit recommend the chirashi and their signatur <unk> roll . be sure to make reserv , as thi place is incred tini and alway busi . i think it can onli seat around 20 peopl , mayb even <unk> , at <unk> .
i had purchas a sofa in which the materi that wa use wa determin to be <unk> . i reach out to the store and within two week , mr. <unk> work with me on a solut . if i were to buy new furnitur , i would go back .
i went to true food kitchen thi weekend expect to eat healthi dish with littl tast ... luckili i wa disappoint ! the food here is amaz ! we start with a sampl of appet : there 's the chicken sausag pizza- one of the better chicken pizza i 've had in a long time . they have <unk> beat ! the tomato fennel sauc wa tangi and the chicken wa veri flavor . next wa the edamam dumpl appet . the edamam past insid wa good , but the sauc they were serv in wa so <unk> ' , it made thi appet superb ! <unk> : my sister and i split two dish , the <unk> curri and the red chili shrimp . actual , the kitchen split it for us ( score ! ) sinc neither of us could decid between the two dish . as a curri lover , i wa pleasantli surpris at how flavor the curri wa . it had just the right amount of <unk> in it , wa creami and overal delici . i think i have a new favorit dish ! while the red chili shrimp wa tasti , it wa less bold ( and memor ) than the curri . for someon who drag her feet think of eat at a <unk> food <unk> i ca n't wait to eat there again !
<unk> did an amaz job ! i have been in az for almost 3 year and have realli had a hard time find a good stylist . he is exactli what i 've been look for . he actual listen to what you want and offer <unk> if he think your idea is n't what 's best for your hair . hi assist <unk> is great as well ! ! she gave me the best shampoo i 've had sinc i 've been here ! !
the worst experi i 've ever had in ani restaur ... <unk> . servic wa incred slow and when i polit ask the manag ( <unk> ) whi it wa take so long he snap at me and said the <unk> would tell me when my food wa readi . i explain to him a parti of 8 in front of me got their burger and a parti behind me in line had alreadi got their burger . he again snap at me and said the buzz would go off when my order wa readi . i advis him i did n't like how he wa talk to me and he rais hi voic and say if i do n't stop yell he would kick me out of the store . i wa have a normal convers and he made up thi lie to <unk> me . i ask for the name of hi boss and he refus to give it to me . i 'm a retir cop and have never been so disrespect by anyon in the servic industri , especi a manag . becaus of how i wa treat by thi manag i will never go to anoth habit burger again and you should n't either .
pizza wa ok for a quick bite ... but have authent pizza with flavor , need go italian restaur . may or may not come back ... <unk> n easi though .
okay - thi place is not a whole food or giant eagl market place . if you want to get some cheap stapl for the week - thi is the place to go . do n't get me wrong - i think i shop at everi groceri store . a few tip ( how they save you money ) . 1 . have a quarter on you . you actual rent your groceri cart . you get your quarter back when you return it to the store . 2 . bring your own bag . the cashier do not bag groceri . they do not even place it in your bag . they will transfer groceri from one cart to anoth much like costco and sam 's . 3 . you will not find everyth . you will want to go there for your stapl ( milk , egg , some meat ( chicken ) , <unk> check it out and determin what you will buy there . you will not find organ or specialti food . you will be surpris on how much money you will save . my first time wa awkward becaus i did not know what to expect . now - i do n't have a problem and have <unk> it into my routin .
so far i 've been here twice and i must say that each experi wa amaz ! i have n't eaten in as of yet but one day i will find the time to do so . i order the chicken holler . the chicken holler includ fri chicken , cheddar and pickl on a biscuit . i opt for medium . medium is the <unk> of 3 flavor . fyi the <unk> is call `` make <unk> holler '' lol . i also had cheddar grit as a side . i have to say thi befor i forget . holler and dash is onli open from 7am to <unk> so if you are look for a late night fix thi is not the place to go . if you are look for weekend morn breakfast or brunch then ye thi is your place ! now back to the regular review . the staff is alway friendli and smile . they are will to explain the menu to you if you 've never been . the food is done in a time manner . definit worth a shot !
my husband and i alway visit thi place becaus i do believ it 's better than <unk> burrito . the food is realli good . the meat is juici and they do cook it in front of you . howev sometim they give me two piec of chicken and i feel like i 'm just eat bread . they need to <unk> their chicken and make sure they are actual give enough meat . i also want to mention for ani salad or ani burrito make sure you get them to drain your bean or you will end up with soggi food .
their air condit is not work even though they will tell you it is . super <unk> and hot insid throughout whole dine experi tonight . let me start off by say they do not know how to answer a phone . call their twice and a gentleman just pick up the phone and say hello never state the busi name . first time i thought i had the wrong number and when i tri to explain what i want he hand the phone off to someon els . it happen again the second time i call as well . they definit need to get better phone custom servic for sure . tri the fri <unk> as an appet . noth special there . the sauc they gave you with it is super spici . so bewar . then order the <unk> style <unk> shu ramen which turn out to be <unk> salti compar to the <unk> style ramen which they <unk> be as be fruiti . the <unk> shu pork wa n't tender enough to fall apart when tri to cut it up with <unk> and a spoon like other ramen place . <unk> shoot we 're extrem hard and tough as well . noodl seem strang to me compar to other ramen joint also . did like the fact that they gave you ground pork in there as well is that with the first time i 've tri that and all the ramen experi i 've had which is quit a few . overal for the price it wa a veri larg portion and through the end of juli they have <unk> on extra noodl and extra corn so you do n't have to pay for it . end up take half of it home and <unk> 'll have a nice lunch for tomorrow . i just need to rememb to drink lot of water to flush the salt from my system . servic wa veri good despit the ac not work . i guess over all the 3 star is becaus their ac wa not work and i just did not like the ramen veri much compar to other place such as <unk> <unk> , ramen <unk> or <unk> . thi place did not stand out for me so i probabl wo n't be go back there .
holi <unk> , you guy . talk about amaz food ! <unk> , i am still <unk> over thi meal and it 's been 4 day ! we love us some bobbi <unk> , so natur we would choos to spend one of our two night at mesa grill . it wa our first time , and we were veri excit . mesa did not disappoint ! we had 7 pm reserv but head to caesar earli to get drink somewher . we end up at mesa earli , and they were abl to seat us right away . perfect , cuz we were hungri ! we had a tabl in the back that wa tini and super close to our neighbor , but after the overal food experi , that did n't matter . we start with cocktail which were tasti . i tri the grapefruit vodka drink and my hubbi had the one with <unk> and cucumb . i am a vodka lover , but we both agre hi wa amaz and <unk> than mine . we order 2 starter - the <unk> prawn tamal and the smoke chicken quesadilla . the tamal wa out of thi world ! i could eat that sauc on basic anyth ... so good ! the shrimp were delici and the tamal wa sweet with big corn <unk> throughout . if you go , you must get thi . a bread basket came with an amaz corn muffin ( but onli one ... which wa sad , haha ) , some jalapeno chees bread and a <unk> walnut bread . not sure whi the 3rd one wa there , but my hubbi like it . we order a second round of drink , and thi is where one star come off . the waiter <unk> a certain margarita , but my hubbi want the <unk> style with hi favorit tequila . the waiter then said , `` sir , if i may , you realli need to get thi one . it 's so smooth ... '' and bla bla bla , so he did , but ask for it on the rock instead of up . it came , up . so we ask again for it on the rock , and it came , but wa onli ok. my hubbi wish the server would have just let him order what he want . for our entre , we share the sear scallop and they were heavenli . they were so crisp on the outsid , well season and perfectli done . the grit it came with were amaz too . definit recommend ! dessert wa the toast coconut cake and i honestli do n't know if i 've ever had cake that good in my life ! so moist , and so <unk> ! what i would n't give for anoth slice ... the ambianc is a littl casual for the price point , but still nice . our server wa attent but the pushi about that <unk> wa <unk> . sometim you just have to let the custom order what they want . all in all , thi wa the best food we had in vega and we will be back !
thi place it the biggest disappoint . it too bad . it ha a great set but the servic is alway slow . order are alway incorrect and the server seem to turn over weekli . i think yesterday will be my last attempt to visit thi place . as the servic wa below averag , the food ( chicken wing , <unk> raw and pink <unk> check your food befor eat it ! ) . and my credit card wa charg three time , all for differ amount , which i am now work with my credit card compani to remov the incorrect charg becaus of the <unk> of the staff at <unk> station . i feel like monthli attempt to give thi place a tri have been in <unk> , i would not recommend thi place , nor would i go back . i have learn my lesson .
solid locat next door to some much busier breakfast place . sometim ya got ta go with tri and true as oppos to wait forev .
poor servic , food is not tasti at all and they do n't have <unk> of chicken . plu , they have sign at everi tabl which say `` do n't wast food , take onli what you think you will eat . '' be awar !
let me start of by say i <unk> countri music , but the onli place i can toler it is at the <unk> ugli . thi spot is ridicul crack and ha a killer happi hour and free shot ! get super crowd so get there earli and get readi for a raunchi , tasteless , awesom , wild time !

alway a favorit spot for great app and sushi . sake select is amaz . best gyoza 's in town ! still have yet to find time for paint <unk> .
there are day i find myself just west of the strip , and when i do , i 've found a great place for sushi . as with most of the ayc sushi place i 've tri , the chef and staff are great here . what make it stand out is the flavor of their roll and sauc to go with the roll . the fish is fresh and flavor . <unk> is price right , in a great locat , near the palm , rio , and gold coast , and when i 'm in that area , crave sushi , thi place is sure to be on the top of my list . one of the best part about <unk> is the select . they have a wide varieti of roll , and so mani delici option . if onli i had known about it sooner , when i use to stay at the rio . the price is typic of most of the other ayc sushi place , and it 's a great choic for tourist and local <unk> . i still have my favorit on the other side of town , but i 'll be back here .
thi gym is like no other . it is the right fit . person train to small group class , knowledg trainer , ani type of work out you imagin or make up these folk got it . wan na train for <unk> cours race , strength train , <unk> condit , lose weight , get faster , <unk> , better ... . thi is the place . quit honestli thi is an adult <unk> . 5 star for free run <unk> . awesom !
andrew <unk> took care of my hous today pay special attent to request i made on area i want address . we have been use <unk> for well over year now both at our resid and our busi . i ca n't say enough good thing . both locat are problem free .
i wa disappoint thi even in my steak sandwich . the meat wa dri and over cook , i ask for mayo and it wa n't even spread over the bun . the custom servic wa veri good , but the sandwich wa n't good at all .
my friend and i stumbl upon here by accid . it wa the last day of our trip and we want a drink at fix , but it wa close . we had dinner reserv at <unk> , so we thought we 'd make our way over there and grab a drink on the way . that 's when we found oliv . their bar wa open so we stop in . their bartend are fantast , their martini are huge and the water show 's wonder . as we were sip our drink , i wa curiou about the infus vodka . that 's when the bartend ask if i 'd like a tast . of cours i would ! so he pour me a good amount , <unk> it up to chill it and serv it up . that 's servic . as we were sit there , sinc the bartend were so nice , we decid to cancel our <unk> reserv and ate at oliv . we also want to sit outsid and watch the fountain show . the patio seat is 1st come , 1st serv and we had no problem with that . what we had a problem with wa the <unk> forc wind blow through . it blew down a bunch of the glass on the tabl , which chang our mind about dine al fresco . onc we were back insid , we order and our app came out . they were huge . just as big as their martini . had i known that , i would 've stuck with just the app . when my entre came out , i could bare eat it and end up take it home . ye , home on the plane - it wa that good . the best part wa that we were sit next to the door and the candl on our tabl kept blow out . but our server wa super dilig in <unk> it over and over again . it wa either dilig , or fear of get hi ass kick for not keep it lit . kudo to him !
ever heard of escap room ? i 'm not sure where they origin ( though i heard about them first in japan ) , but they 're a sort of real life puzzl game . basic , a group of peopl is lock insid a room and given a certain amount of time to solv the puzzl insid in order to find a way out . if you 've ever play <unk> ( on the <unk> ) or it <unk> , zero escap : <unk> 's last reward ( on the <unk> and <unk> ) , imagin someth like that in real life , just without all the <unk> . anyway , ever sinc i heard about real life escap room i 've been want to tri one but have n't had the opportun until now , when my whole famili decid to give it a shot . as a note , you need to reserv a time in advanc . and , unless your group buy up all the ticket for that room , you may be team up with some other peopl . they have three differ room ( with a fourth open soon ) , and we chose the apart . after a brief explan , our team ( myself , my parent , brother , <unk> , and a coupl <unk> girl we were group with ) were lock in the room and the <unk> began . you have one hour to solv the puzzl and escap the room . fail ... and they let you out of the room anyway , though without the sens of accomplish that come from escap yourself . i do n't want to say much of anyth about the puzzl to avoid spoil thing for ani of you who may want to tri it , but our room wa compris of a three room apart fill with puzzl and lock . most of our job involv find the variou key , code , and the like need to <unk> cabinet , safe , etc . some of the puzzl were fairli <unk> while other requir a good bit of critic and occasion later think . there wa a big <unk> on one wall with our current time <unk> down , as well as occasion hint provid by our guid , who wa watch us on secur camera in anoth room . the hint were use and target at whatev we were stuck on but , at the same time , they were n't too frequent and did n't give too much away either . though they certainli did help us out at a coupl of point . in the end , i think everyon <unk> significantli to at least one or two of the puzzl and we manag to success escap with about five minut to <unk> . while not the cheapest way to spend an hour , it wa a lot of fun and everyon ( even my parent ) had a realli good time . while i do n't know when i 'll next have the time , i 'd love to go back and take a crack at one of the other room .
avoid . came in <unk> on a sunday , the place wa empti , the hostess made us wait for <unk> to be seat while take 2 call with onlin order . then anoth 10 min for the waiter to show up . ask for our 5-6 roll to be serv in a boat ( first time experi for kid ) , the waiter went and check with the chef , who refus ( ! ) . appar you need to order 8 roll to be elig for a fanci plate in an empti restaur . menu were sticki , place look dirti , we decid to spend our $ $ $ elsewher . avoid , there are much better option in the area .
hubbi love their wood fire pizza . i 'll be tri the gluten free option next time . we get the <unk> fri everi time : so delish ! tonight they had live music on the patio . veri cool vibe .

i 've visit a lot of <unk> memori , <unk> , and other like build over the year . i came across the garfield memori as i wa look for the <unk> angel at lake view <unk> . i wa drawn to the build becaus of the <unk> . i wa glad i visit the second week of april sinc it open for the season on april 1st . lucki ! ! ! tip : thi is a <unk> build that ha a lot of stair in <unk> format . the stair are quit narrow and there is a <unk> onli on one side . upon enter , i wa greet by a volunt who wa extrem friendli and quit knowledg . i start out downstair in the <unk> area . behind lock bar , there are two <unk> ( <unk> garfield and <unk> garfield ) and two <unk> ( <unk> , their daughter and husband <unk> ) . i walk around the entir circl and wa <unk> by the oil heater which were <unk> in their design . i know ... oil heater ? ye , they were <unk> . from there , i went upstair to get a view of the garfield statu from the top . the high ceil , light , and overal design is <unk> . i continu my journey to the balconi where you can get a shot of downtown cleveland . on your way out , be sure to visit the small gift area , make a <unk> , and buy a map of the <unk> ( the <unk> with descript ) . for $ 5 , it will save you some time wander around .
just to be clear : the onli comment made about <unk> were in regard to her terribl servic . after mix up our drink order , then our food order , and have to be flag down as she zip around serv everyon but us on a clearli slow night , it 's to be expect . if we made her so uncomfort , she made no effort to get us out of there faster . it took nearli 20 minut to get our bill ! addit , my 60 year old mother and my brother 's girlfriend were in attend that night , and they certainli would have had an opinion if anyon wa <unk> the staff in anyway . but all thi is <unk> . your ignor and <unk> respons to my review onli make my decis to never eat the gener , flavorless food and deal with the aw servic that much easier .
what realli annoy me is when peopl look into your eye and lie to you . <unk> thi place give a militari discount of 10 % . last time i wa here i wa told they gave me a militari discount an the receipt onli show a 5 % . today the guy told me he gave me $ 6.00 off , wrong ... i wa charg full price for the product and tax no discount . time to take my busi to anoth store . these guy had two chanc and the employe are extrem <unk> and disrespect . sad sad sad as i use to like thi place but now they have peopl work <unk> who have no respect for militari or custom , onli make the most money for the store .

a realli realli good experi here at <unk> . friendli staff greet everyon onc they enter , decent price . the salsa absolut <unk> the show . the chip and <unk> for $ <unk> is a rel steal in toronto , and wa tangi and flavour . i tri three differ option at the salsa bar and came away impress with all of them . the <unk> fish taco were soft and flavour , as wa the chicken <unk> . decor and vibe are on point . will be back .
i stop by for a quick lunch and <unk> love thi place . their drink select is amaz so mani beer and their <unk> is huge ! and even better their food is amaz . the burger are soo good and appet were out of thi world . doubl royal and calamari were my two favorit . the staff wa also amaz the bartend wa great to talk to and the manag talk to us and wa super friendli thi will be my new go to spot
i went here on a <unk> , and veri hungri ! i wa surpris to find a favorit in their meatbal sub . it is delici on so mani level . the bread realli make it i think . i 'm not sure if they bake it in hous or buy fresh and local , but it 's alway toast perfectli but soft on the insid . plu , they pile on the mozzarella chees and have a good ratio of sauc ( i love my marinara sauc ! ) . just keep in mind if you 're pop in you may have to wait for about 15 minut , but that ensur you 're get a fresh made dish . if you 're realli in a hurri make sure you call ahead . i realli need to take a break from the meatbal sub , if possibl , and tri their pizza next !
i normal have noth good to say about pep boy , but the employe at thi locat were a save grace dure an otherwis all around <unk> weekend last year . the boy and i drove to vega for the weekend in hi mini cooper for hi colleg <unk> and for my sister 's annual <unk> parti . we drove over to pari to meet up with two of hi colleg friend , and when we got back to the car to drive them back to their hotel , the batteri in the cooper wa dead . when the tow truck final arriv , the guy had an aw time get the car jump . it took him about 30 minut and the batteri wa bare keep a charg . everi minut or so the light would dim and the car sound like it wa go to die . we had no idea where the closest mini dealer wa , and sinc it wa earli even we figur their servic depart would be close anyway . i rememb see a pep boy on charleston close to my sister 's hous so we head over , <unk> pray that the <unk> would not die on the freeway on the way there . sadli when we got to pep boy , they did not have ani mini cooper <unk> batteri . they told us to check the auto zone down the street . luckili we had not turn off the car . <unk> the sweet babi jesu , auto zone had a batteri . but they would not instal it for us . luckili we kept the car run again . the boy bought the batteri anyway and fear the worst , we head back to pep boy . the guy at pep boy were nice enough to instal the new auto zone batteri for us sad folk from california even though it wa by now close to close time for them . and best of all , they did n't charg us anyth for the instal . they got some seriou good <unk> that day , and i thank them for all of their help !
alway veri help and honest . will check your car and give suggest rather than bill you for stuff they didnt even do . will definit be come as a regular when need .
select not the best . price are averag . qualiti of cloth is about the same as <unk> . not too mani high end name brand item . i would consid thi place more of a bargain if they lower their price .
classic dive bar , but with great food . thi place is interest from when you go in . they have some tabl game such as tabl bowl and air hockey . they also have a small concert area where they have <unk> , band , etc . i wa there at an off time , so it wa rel slow , but wa get busi while peopl were wait for a band to start . the food wa good . there wa few choic , the main dish are hot dog , slider , and burger . there is probabl 25 top to pick from for your hot dog , which make thing fun . the price are decent . the servic wa also good ( from a brand new waitress ) . thi place is interest how they integr staff into their design . their facebook post introduc them and they have specialti cocktail that each bartend make up . thi place also ha good special . on saturday afternoon , they have $ 1 slider , which i will have to check out sometim .
two thing i love about sprout : the deli sandwich and their tropic island fruit mix . the deli here is just awesom . sandwich are big , cheap , and pack with delici . when i work in the area , i would grab lunch here at least twice a week . which bring me to my next , <unk> point ... everi so often , they 'd <unk> screw up my sandwich order . i do n't know how it happen . for the <unk> , sprout ha a seemingli effici order system . everi ingredi is list on a piec of paper and you indic what you would like . if someth doe n't have a check mark next to it , it doe n't get put onto the sandwich . so whi do you put mustard on my turkey masterpiec just often enough to notic ? i do n't know how i could possibl make your job ani easier than it alreadi should be . asid from sandwich , their tropic island fruit mix is the best of ani groceri chain . if you 're into dri fruit , it come highli recommend .
i made a pit stop at thi restaur for a quick bite with my friend befor watch a movi . our waiter gave us our menu and then disappear for <unk> . we had to get anoth server to order our app . there were about 3 differ peopl help us get 1 app and 1 desert put through . the inconsist and wait time wa ridicul . we had to eat our food realli fast so we would n't miss our movi . the food wa alright . the spinach dip with warm pretzel wa nice but the nacho were kinda stale . the desert wa pretti good - the fri donut ball tast fresh and came with 3 differ sauc ( caramel , chocol and lemon ) . the onli sauc that tast good with the donut wa the caramel sauc . the chocol sauc tast water down and the lemon one just tast gross . my overal rate ha a lot to do with the custom servic . i should n't have to chase down my waiter to order food , ask for the bill or ask for a simpl water refil . that 's huge pet <unk> of mine - it should n't be hard to fill up an empti water glass .
thi place is so yummi ! the food here is great and the menu ha great varieti . the not <unk> mama grill chees is amaz ! <unk> wa our server and she wa outstand , such a great attitud and wa veri attent . all the staff look like they work realli well togeth . it 's a great environ . thi is definit a must tri restaur !
call ultim plumb , made an appoint to have plumb issu resolv . <unk> came on time wa veri courteou and knowledg . he even use bleach to clean the area he had been work in . the price are veri reason and <unk> did a great job . i would recommend them to everyon .
i am veri , veri disappoint in jj 's . we had a parti of 20 here today , to celebr two birthday . my boyfriend and i brought in two cake . we were told it 's a dollar per head . we ask sinc when wa the polici ha been in affect , sinc thi is not the first time we had brought cake to celebr birthday . we were told by an older gentleman that it ha been in place for a coupl year now . now i know that is a lie , sinc all the other birthday have been recent . and then older gentleman tri to cover hi lie by chang hi polici ha been affect for a year and half , anoth lie . basic the man is make up just ani excus to grab some extra money . becaus he ha never mention it to us mani event befor . and now let 's get to the servic , we wait at the <unk> for a good half hour befor greet . anoth 15-20 minut to be seat , even though we have had thi reserv a week in advanc . the food wa lack , they kept forget half the stuff we order . the food wa <unk> . and the final let down ... we gave specif instruct for the cake , which candl goe on which , we even <unk> the box with the number . pleas tell me how the cake were brought out without the candl on and not lit up . and then they ask the birthday boy which candl goe on which . how do you mess thi up ? ! over all veri disappoint .
awesom spot , a real gem for charlott to have . thursday & sat music is a great outing for the entir famili .
use to love thi theater , but it 's been more of a hassl come here late , not sure how much longer we 'll keep it up . the last few time we came , there wa alway an issu ... while it 's nice they are put in new seat , the seat are not good for shorter leg . i guess the idea is you put the <unk> up , but not everyon want to do that . onc it 's up , it 's extrem hard to adjust , whether go too far or not enough or not do anyth at all ... seat should n't have to come with instruct . the new bar area is nice but it <unk> a bathroom . you 'd think with be down to onli one bathroom in the lobbi , it would be cleaner , but it wa n't . the snack bar area is alway a mess in the self serv area . i prefer get ticket at the booth outsid . even if someon is work the entranc insid , they make you use the machin now & i do n't normal bring read glass to the movi ... <unk> do n't like touch the same screen everyon els ha on line , alway feel i have to wash my hand afterward . lastli with 30 theater , whi they have onli a few show & limit so mani show to reserv seat is the biggest inconveni & ha us go to <unk> instead . we 're just not feel thi place anymor . it wa so much better befor they went & chang everyth .

well i rate thi busi a 2 becaus they would n't talk to me face to face over secur deposit issu after i move out . now chang it to a 1 becaus it 's been 3 month now . i 'm still tri to get back my secur deposit . after receiv an item invoic and question paint carpet and blind charg . they would n't respond to a <unk> that explain the situat and item in concern . even after state in the invoic if there were ani question or concern pleas give them a call . look like we just might have to go to small claim court . do n't wast your time with thi compani unless you want them to tri and steal your secur deposit .
regal <unk> ha earn a reput in certain circl for be the best place for wing in town and they live up to their reput . noth fanci , just wing and beer . that 's all i expect and that 's what i got when i stop in on my way out of town one night . lot of cold <unk> and delici , meati wing . they 're cheap too , depend what night you show up . it 's small and can get crowd at time , but that 's what you expect for the price you pay . there are a few locat around town and everi place keep up the qualiti . it 's not necessarili the <unk> and <unk> place , but all thing consid , the regal <unk> is a great place for wing and beer and nobodi make ani apolog for that .
cocktail are good if a littl pricey , home made spirit are <unk> . can be hard to get a seat on a weekend and can take a while to get serv . overal veri enjoy , howev , and will be back .
clean , <unk> environ and a larg select of one- to <unk> <unk> you , but what make me return are the friendli attend , who tri their best to offer assist ! i love how <unk> your even ask , they 'll run outsid and retriev the <unk> cart from you , but not befor help you load your full basket into your car ! these attend deserv rais for work as hard like they do . you '' <unk> find chang and <unk> machin ( <unk> food and clean materi ) if you need anyth , and there are tv and free wi-fi to keep you compani while you wait ! ( one gripe : pleas add some electr <unk> ! )
brown road , just east of higley . next door to kfc , just to the east of kfc on the south side of brown road . easi access off brown or exit higley by the iowa cafe . check out the menu onlin first . no indoor seat or dine . drive through or <unk> to a differ window . averag time order to deliveri is about five minut or less . great food , decent price . cute bright orang plastic fork which are mostli <unk> becaus they bend to easili . i think they recent rais their price across the board . like most carri out restaur their napkin are not worth take , they do not toler actual be use like most of them are these day .
love the varieti of food to choos from march . everyth from healthi to the not so ; and everyth from pizza to <unk> . i end up with a roast beef wrap that came with a bowl of veget soup . the wrap wa meati and delici . and it wa made right in front of me quickli . just make sure you do n't lose the card given to you . that 's what you use to pay . the environ itself is nice . there is an area that feel like a patio , and then there are area insid where you can sit down . it 's nice decor like a restaur . an upscal <unk> !
thi place is ador ! it like denni meet <unk> . it greasi spoon food - veri yummi . they have a separ restaur and loung . if you come on a sunday or holiday , make sure to come earli becaus they get a line out the door . it worth it though with the decor and food . the loung is cute with fire pit and comfi couch . not realli <unk> access in the loung , but the restaur is fine . if you like ice cream , order the sunday - but be warn it about 5 lb of ice cream !
thi place is great for no frill , basic `` do it your self '' <unk> furnitur . you pick what you like and usual end up get what you paid for . howev be awar , their manag ha absolut no concept of a thing call custom servic . recent , i bought a din set from them , which wa miss some part , when i contact the store , the manag <unk> said that he will contact hi <unk> in <unk> , and will get the miss part in about a week time . well i wait for a week , and after not hear back from thi guy , call him again . onc again the person did not offer ani apolog or regret , and ask me to wait anoth 5-10 day . well after give it anoth week i call the person again , and wa told that if i can not wait for the part to arriv from asia , i can go to scarborough and pick it myself from a warehous , he simpli refus to get it deliv to me or even have it avail at hi store for me to pick up . as i had no other option left , i had to drive all the way from <unk> to scarborough to pick the miss part , which could simpli have been deliv to me in a legal size <unk> . well i have learn my lesson well and will never be buy from thi place again . so if you still decid to go ahead and tri them , just hope you do n't have to do a return or replac .
i made a reserv on a mon for a wed night . good thing i did ! i wa quit surpris that the place wa fill up by <unk> . walk into s & f , the environ and feel is veri modern and upscal . you would think that thi would be a place serv someth other than japanes ( let alon sushi ) . i order salmon & white tuna sashimi , spici salmon roll , rainbow roll , fresh mango salad , edamam bean , <unk> style pad thai and pineappl fri rice , butter fish <unk> ( thi wa for 2 peopl ) . qualiti and <unk> , the sashimi certainli wa not anywher close to what smaller restaur serv up in markham . the mango salad wa certainli tasti and just the right portion . my favourit would be the pad thai and fri rice . they were both sweet ( in tast ) and the pad thai had a good amount of heat . i end the night off with a deep fri ice cream which me and my friend enjoy . i believ the batter is made up of corn flake ! the speed at which my 2nd order came out were unfortun slow . the place wa certainli pack which could 've explain whi . it took about 15 minut for my green tea to arriv at the tabl .
key featur : best cook swiss chalet burger in the gta yeah yeah - so there wa that one time on mother 's day when the waitress mess up our order , gave us cold food , and wa an all around , less than delight server - but i tell you what - year of be fantast will help me look past that . there 's one reason to come to thi swiss chalet - and i 'll tell you what it is , their burger . i do n't know whi the other swiss chalet 's in the gta ca n't cook them properli ( and believ you me , i 've search around ) but thi place - they put a patti on a bun that is so juici , you 'd think it wa cook straight off of a georg <unk> grill ( if you believ the hype about how well a georg <unk> grill can cook burger . which i do n't . ) the point is - do n't think of thi swiss chalet as a chicken join . think of it as a burger joint . now , i do n't want you to go there , have the one time they 're not cook to perfect - becaus as i said abov , i - too - had a bad experi onc . by 90 % of the time , there 's noth more that i would want from my meal . it 's an all around treat . and a great place to kick back with <unk> , and talk about life , and all that come between it .
bad meat and bad custom servic ! ! i order the roast beef panini and the roast beef wa green and shini . i call to complain and their respons wa we just cut it so it can not be bad . my compani use to order from them all the time -- no more .
place : cool theme with a great environ . servic is n't alway the greatest . music is alright too . <unk> : unless you 're get an orang bowl with an ice <unk> , you 're probabl not go to enjoy it for too long . the regular head are n't good and the flavour are limit ( or not as <unk> as other place )
amaz staff and dr. row ( ? ) wa amaz with my dog . brought my pit bull in for a mass . they made sure to go over everi detail with me and everi cost that would <unk> as we went through the procedur . reason price ! my vet now ! could n't pictur take my fur babi elsewher .
yum ! ! ! final , a place that serv fri chicken . and not just ani fri chicken ; the best fri chicken i 've had in phoenix ! the catfish wa also delici . we tri the macaroni , green bean , cole slaw , and fri ( for the toddler ) . the side alon could be a meal . we did n't have anyth to take home , so we order rib to go . the owner are friendli and greet you as you walk in and then they come around to check on you and chat for a few minut . we will be back , to tri the rest of the menu . keep in mind thi is not fast food . it will take 20 minut or so to prepar your meal for you . good food is alway worth the wait , in my opinion .
best item i had that i would go back again for : <unk> fri item order : - potato <unk> : it wa fun to see a huge pile of <unk> . a bit of a smokey tast . if you like a <unk> version of <unk> chip , thi one is for you . - southwest chicken salad : noth spectacular . the lettuc which <unk> most of the salad wa a bit bitter . it would 've been better if more of the `` other '' item list on the menu were present . - mini burger sampler : the turkey burger wa tastiest of all 3 ( <unk> ) . beef burger wa standard for a sit down restaur . ahi burger did n't have enough ahi . it wa two thin slice . so , you were bite mostli into bread . - captain hook burger ( fri cod ) : the crust wa veri salti , but the crispi of the fish wa excel . i did n't care for the sweet relish . - ice tea : perfect ... . freshli brew servic : veri slow ( they need to hire a runner to deliv the food to the tabl ... especi sinc they sold over <unk> groupon deal . ) price : pricier than smash burger for about the same qualiti just nicer ambianc ambianc : a fun place to go on a casual date . cute decor ( contemporari <unk> ? ) the booth are great for realli tall peopl . for short peopl like me , it felt like i saw sink in the seat and had to sit up to reach the tabl . i would onli go back for the turkey burger & the shoe string fri , but i 'd have to get some kind of deal becaus their price are just more than mani of the other restaur around town .
thi place wa great ! i went for my first time yesterday . i got the lobster tail meal with mac and chees , broccoli and corn . the broccoli wa just okay but everyth els wa soooo great . it 's a tini place with just a few chair . more of a take out place but you can sit to eat . i will be back !
hate it ... . waiter wa a <unk> pretti hot but definit knew it tri to pull the whole <unk> thing then <unk> for 20 minut and expect us to be ok with it <unk> bud . the whole place is overpr i mean i know it vega but still 15 dollar for a margarita in a martini glass ? ! wtf ... we get the chip and salsa and they are pretti good chipotl salsa decent chip . i order the <unk> and it show up made out of oj and ha <unk> orang in it <unk> way to sweet cant even tast the shrimp <unk> . my friend got the veggi enchilada and the veggi tast like oil not even butter which would have been better they did use <unk> chees though . we high tail it out of there after that thank good
for anyon who ha tri call , they are inde still open . they just never answer their phone , or even have a <unk> set up . mayb they should answer their phone , so they can perhap allow <unk> seat ? becaus the place is pack on the weekend and often ha a wait out the door . for the most part , the food is good and the portion are larg . the staff is nice , too . not the best place in pittsburgh for breakfast , but a solid option .
i want authent thai food like how my mom make it so i decid to tri thi spot out after check out their menu option . i had their <unk> ( chicken salad ) and papaya salad - it definit wa worth it . i would go back again to tri out more .
the worst custom servic and the worst qualiti of ani nail salon i 've ever been to ... . , i have went to thi salon <unk> time over the past 5 year . i 'm now post thi review to help other from a stress nail experi . even though thi is the closest nail salon to my hous , i will go to my favorit island nail salon on <unk> and <unk> or tri the one across cooper for my first time . i have post <unk> review on yelp and thi is my first neg review . so i 'm not an onlin complain unless it 's so bad that even the <unk> is ugli toward client and from their attitud it seem they do n't care about their client
i got a deep condit with a cut and style and sinc i wa a new client it wa onli $ 60 pretti good deal ! <unk> is awesom she listen and did exactli what i want with my hair ! i definit would recommend see her for all your hair need ! ! if you need more review there are ton on googl ! i wa veri impress with how thi salon is decor accent of green and purpl with huge mirror with <unk> frame veri pretti !
get into <unk> 's <unk> ! went there thi week , and order their limit time anniversari special : dinner for two includ ny strip , king crab leg , with garlic mash potato and roast brussel sprout , and one dessert for onli $ <unk> . each diner start with the choic of soup or salad and bread basket . love how the crab leg were complet split in <unk> annoy crack here . the steak wa veri good . but it wa the dessert that realli stood out : we chose bake alaska , which wa incred ! ! ! the waiter explain thi dessert is n't alway offer , so call ahead . it 's worth the wait : a <unk> <unk> browni top with chocol ice cream , all coat with a nice brown <unk> . just . awesom .
serious , the best spring roll , and crab curri . some of the item are serv at the spice level the chef make it , and i love that . the chef know best , and is not will to <unk> . i came here onc and sat across from <unk> wood . i ca n't say enough about thi place . love it !
the servic here wa just ok . took a long time to get our food . the food wa good , i especi like the tempura and the <unk> . we 'll be back , hope servic will be better .
the cashier , `` <unk> <unk> '' wa extrem rude . there wa n't a line at thi regist , and now i see whi . when we ask about tri our phone number , without say anyth , he point at the card <unk> machin , then as i wa input my phone number , he <unk> hi own card . what wa the purpos in tell me to do it myself , if he wa just go to collect my point ? it wa just dumb . no big deal though , i just do n't understand the reason behind it . then anoth custom put her groceri on the <unk> belt , but sinc there wa n't a transact separ bar thing , she kept hold her groceri , which in turn kept the automat <unk> belt go . he look at her and say , `` stop ! just stop touch it ! the belt will stop by itself ! '' i wa immedi disgust by hi attitud . even if she did n't know that it wa automat , he did n't have to come at her like that ! he could of simpli said , `` do n't worri about the belt , it 'll stop on it own , '' or someth accord to that . hi attitud wa complet <unk> . after he bag all of our groceri , it wa veri evid he just gave no <unk> today . he put my banana with all the can good , my meat with my veget , and my juic and bottl product with my egg ; all make them heavi , and i had to doubl bag them myself at the end . the store itself wa just like ani other <unk> 's . outdat , and <unk> but at the same time , organ . if i were to come back to thi locat , i will not be go to <unk> 's regist . i do n't care if all the other line are super long and i have to wait 30 minut to check out . he definit ruin my day !
i love <unk> . it 's not the <unk> place to eat but it 's oh so delici . as far as starter go , the pretzel with chees dip are delici . it doe n't tast like cheap low grade pretzel out of a freezer . they are perfectli crisp yet fluffi insid . the wing are great and they give you a perfect amount for one person . i got the <unk> and the mozzarella wa fresh as were the veggi . it had the perfect amount of spice . the balsam drizzl wa right amount of sweet . i never save room for dessert but i need to sometim to tri their shake . friend of mine <unk> by their burger and i will certainli be back to tri one soon !
jamba juic is jamba juic . i ca n't realli rate thi place higher or wors than my other review , becaus it 's just the same experi at ani jamba juic you go to . same set , same menu , same servic , same same same . onli differ here is that it 's in la vega and it might be a lot easier to enjoy it in thi heat more , but other than that it 's just the same as it is back at home ( san <unk> ) . so i 'm just go to copi and past my other jamba juic review on to here ... ... ... . alway love thi place especi on a nice <unk> day . depend on the weather is what i usual get <unk> . if it 's just a normal day and i need that extra <unk> of energi , i usual stop by here befor head to school and grab me a doubl shot <unk> energi with oj . if my stomach feel a littl empti i usual grab me a pretzel becaus it easi to eat on the go . their sandwich are good too , i just do n't like to get e 'm often becaus i 'm usual in a hurri . i have yet to tri ani other compet smoothi place becaus thi alreadi complet my satisfact , but it 's still lack a star , becaus i feel that it can do better and there just might be anoth smoothi spot that tast better that i have yet to tri . on a hot day or when i 'm just in the mood for a smoothi , i get a a `` white gummi '' which is on their secret menu , and employe make it tast like the white gummi bear candi . i like to get other too , but thi is my all time favorit . there is a few other on the secret menu , that most if not all jamba juic 's make . you can easili search up jamba juic secret menu and you 'll find a bunch of e 'm , but here is a few of my favorit . pink star : made to tast like everyon 's all time <unk> flavor ( pink <unk> ) <unk> gummi : made to tast like the color coat gummi bear chocol gummi bear : made to tast like the chocol cover gummi bear you get at the store <unk> 's piec : made to tast like the candi bar . <unk> : made to tast like the <unk> candi . note : rememb there is way more on the secret menu , but those are just some of my favorit . there is a list below of some of the other that i have n't tri yet , and rememb there are more , just do a quick search . also keep in mind that not all shop make them , so ask them if they can make it befor you order it . i 'm not quit sure how healthi these are suppos to be ( i heard that they 're not on the menu becaus they do n't recommend them becaus it 's onli a snack smoothi , not someth as healthi as their normal menu ) , so if some of you guy are that are tri to watch your diet , you might consid check the nutrit on these , but if you 're just tri to tri someth differ , then go wild ! <unk> ' surpris <unk> pie <unk> <unk> <unk> gummi bear <unk> <unk> <unk> cover strawberri <unk> gummi bear <unk> orgasm <unk> pebbl <unk> gummi bear <unk> jesu <unk> <unk> <unk> wave <unk> and later <unk> dream machin <unk> passion <unk> butter and jelli <unk> <unk> <unk> dreamin' <unk> fruiti pebbl <unk> gummi bear <unk> <unk> <unk> dreamin' <unk> gummi bear <unk> piec <unk> diego <unk> orgasm <unk> <unk> kid <unk> ( aka pink star ) *strawberri dreamin' *strawberri <unk> *strawberri <unk> <unk> delight <unk> you jesu <unk> roll <unk> <unk> <unk> fruiti pebbl <unk> gummi bear

thi place wa wonder ! took my mother and sister here . 30 minut full massag for $ 15 , but we went for the full hour for $ 30 ... best choic for us ! took us back in to a <unk> , calm section in the back , start with a foot soak , then start at the head and work down to feet , flip us , then pull some cirqu du soleil magic crawl up our back on their <unk> . total amaz and would recommend thi to anyon want a great massag at an even greater price !
had a lot of food at <unk> with friend . it wa a veri great experi . for entre , i had salmon , it wa beyond my expect ! the fish wa soft insid and crispi outsid . it wa also veri flavor !
had never been befor and wa told to check it out . great food and great servic by <unk> .
how doe thi compar to my own mother 's dumpl ? it ca n't compar . but it wa still worth a tri to see what thi place wa about . we arriv just befor the dinner rush , and were abl to be seat immedi . the decor is tacki <unk> red <unk> hang throughout the restaur . just want to grab a snack , we share 12 of the bok choy and pork boil dumpl . i 'm assum that the dumpl are made to order so we had to wait a bit befor the food arriv . then , a heap plate of freshli boil dumpl arriv . i wa pretti excit to tri it out , get myself prepar with the soy , vinegar , and the sriracha . dip the dumpl into the sauc , i took a bite . the skin wa n't too thick , the fill wa flavor , and there wa also a bit of soup within . the pork wa n't too fatti , but there wa a lack of bok choy , which i would have prefer to have more of . these were n't the best dumpl i 've ever had , but they were good . so , whenev you 're crave dumpl , it 's sure the perfect comfort food on a cold winter day .
larg portion ! especi the <unk> the pancak were good veri larg good select of sandwich also . they onli accept cash . go at an off time so you do n't have to wait in line . good shake and the waiter are friendli . nice cozi atmospher .
absolut by far the worst compani ever ! what a scam artist thi compani is ! we purchas a home may , 2015 and i transfer servic may 5 , 2015 . keep in mind that the address i use is a mail address . i still have thi mail address . last week i switch all of our servic over to cox becaus i found out that centurylink told me that i need a home <unk> in order to have internet servic . so for 2 year i paid $ 50 a month too much becaus i wa lie to by the salesperson at centurylink . and the mad doe n't stop there . today i receiv a call from a collect agenc say i owe $ <unk> from two year ago . sinc i still have that mail address you would think that if i owe thi money i would have receiv a bill from centurylink ! but <unk> they wait until i cancel my servic and then immedi sent me to collect for some <unk> bill that due although i wa with them for 3 year and never miss a bill ! ! ! ! ! ! you guy suck and are terribl . i call centurylink and bill told me she doe n't even know what it for but to go ahead and pay it so my credit is n't ruin ! again centurylink suck ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i will never ever return to your terribl servic or crappi account practic ! you suck ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

went here today with my cousin the food wa awesom delici : ) nice environ and atmospher with great custom servic 5 star all the way . will definit be go here again sooner then later ! !
app were great but entre were realli salti . i realli regret not order the french onion soup becaus it look delici . we had a front row seat at the bar face the kitchen , so we were abl to see the chef cook and all the food come out . it wa a great experi howev after a 6 hour drive from new york , i would 've prefer a tabl . howev , thi wa not the restaur that i intend to go to for dinner so i did not make a reserv think that it would not be too crowd at <unk> pm . boy wa i wrong , all tabl were reserv so we took seat at the bar and by the time we left the line wa out the door . food wa good , the tartar wa phenomen and the servic wa excel but i realli do n't see the hype . but then again , i should 've found out what <unk> wa befor order it . i saw a tart , saw foie , and i wa sold . i did n't realiz it wa a tart made up of blood sausag . i do n't like blood sausag and the tart itself wa way too salti . the pork <unk> wa way too salti as well , howev the risotto wa perfectli cook . i would give thi place anoth tri if i had opportun , i feel i order all the wrong dish . the duck in a can look realli interest and the <unk> stuf with <unk> and foie sound pretti amaz , but sinc we 're onli in montreal for 3 day , not go to happen .
rachel 's kitchen is a quick fix for a healthi meal . i typic love their big breakfast with toast , egg , potato , and switch out the bacon with turkey bacon . i also love that they have <unk> bowl ! thi locat is big , but the flow is decent . mean that even when it 's busi i did n't have to wait a long time to get the food . it 's also easili access by an easi exit on the summerlin <unk> . i heard that they have unlimit mimosa too , but i have not had a chanc to tri . next time !
i love the rebel loung ! it 's near my hous and they have some awesom band come through . it 's one of my favorit venu in phoenix . it may be small , but who doe n't like to get up close with the music ? ! the bar here is also great . they have a decent select on draft , but the can are where it 's at ! i can find just about ani local brew here and they rotat their stock regularli . i can usual tri someth new at everi show !
i went to visit thi place for an event . it wa at a nice locat , but , thi place need some work and clean up . it wa veri warm in there for hot night . the place ha <unk> furnitur and a smell . the place ha potenti , but , need some love .
i have n't been back here in a long time and the restaur certainli age so much . it 's old and run down . the atmospher wa not pleasant . we were n't even acknowledg when we enter . we were just stand there wait for a few minut befor the server came to sit us down and it 's not even busi . the food wa not what it use to be , dri and not flavor . we have had better thai food and probabl wo n't be back .

i brought my cat by to have her nail trim last minut and i found them to be veri quick and accommod , and the staff and owner were all veri pleasant . the trim wa reason price , but when i ask about full groom fee i felt they were on the expens side . i would expect those fee if you are do someth special like a <unk> cut on a cat , but not just a standard groom appoint . i will definit bring her back for a nail trim !
grotto ha the best pizza i have ever eaten ! ! ( in la vega ) . be from chicago thi pizza is ... well , differ ... . i never would have consid eat at the golden <unk> . <unk> it reput ( to me ) wa an old dumpi casino in old dumpi downtown vega , but a co <unk> recommend it so we gave it a tri . we sat at the bar , order a nice <unk> and were happi to find out it wa `` happi hour '' . for 7 buck we had the most delici '' roast herb chicken and garlic , mozzarella , basil , caramel onion , roast tomato and goat chees '' pizza ! ! ! delici . i definit will go back to grotto ! !

you need to visit thi new spot in <unk> for some great food and live music . the place is veri intim and have a small bar , a few tabl and a danc floor . the decor wa on point . they put a lot of thought into the music venu detail , from the larg <unk> wall that act as a <unk> to the musician , to the actual <unk> in the bar . there wa a fun band there that wa rock it out all night . i love loud music , howev , it got a littl too loud at time . all part of the experi , right ? ! the staff wa veri friendli and took time to answer our question . perfect small bar menu of food choic . we order 4 differ item off the menu . the beef and onion slider were veri flavor . chicken and waffl were awesom , howev wish the waffl were a littl <unk> . the grill chees sandwich wa <unk> it had spinach and wa press in a waffl iron , and the <unk> that came with it were extra special with some spici flavor . the tempura onion ring were perfectli season , but wish they were a big <unk> as well . the onion ring and chicken and waffl were servic on drum stick <unk> . cool touch . ill definit be back again ! !

thi is blueberri hill <unk> locat . they took over and remodel the old mari <unk> 's build . it look great insid now . veri modern and clean . casual atmospher . i think thi is the first <unk> with a small bar area . if you 're look for a real `` old school '' breakfast , thi is the place . best pancak in town plu a wide varieti of bacon , egg , sausag , hash brown and the <unk> blueberri muffin ( i usual get a coupl to go ) . they have plenti of good lunch and dinner item , too . turkey dinner is a favorit and burger , too . i 'd probabl go here more often if they had salmon , prime rib or mayb even a ribey steak but that 's just me . do n't get me wrong , there are plenti of item to choos from . the dessert , especi the chocol cake , are delici . they have sever special everi day , too . plu they have good park despit be on one of la vega 's busiest street - flamingo . i still like the <unk> on <unk> , too .
my friend realli want to tri their surf and <unk> pho - rib eye and lobster . they thought the flavor wa good and like the combo . i opt for the oxtail pho . my bowl wa tasti as the flavor from the oxtail made it great . i like how the meat wa cook and easili come off the bone . we also order the oxtail fri and the beef salad . the fri almost remind me of poutin fri . they were a bit soggi as the <unk> soak in them . the beef salad wa good as the beef wa veri tender ( i wish the piec were a bit better ) .
we got two differ meal here and both were perfect . the chicken wa season as it should be and the steak and onion wa tender . i will absolut be go back .

thi wa a weird experi . i come here everi time i come to <unk> and thi experi wa a littl off . the bartend seem <unk> , she liter had n't greet us for a coupl minut then came to us and gave us drink we did n't order . the other bartend said `` thank for bear with us '' . we saw two other peopl walk away after be sat for a coupl minut and not be serv . i saw the <unk> fall on the floor and the bar back pick it up and set it up for use . pretti disappoint . it 's never like thi ...
i have maintain an account with wachovia ( now well fargo ) for mani year . it 's onli in the past year that i 've <unk> to question how much longer i 'll continu to do so . especi sinc i have account at a few other <unk> institut and i have n't had ani problem with those busi . my experi insid thi branch wa so-so . i stood in a long line and made my deposit at a teller station that wa too close to the line and too close to the other teller station for ani privaci that may be requir dure a bank transact . but i think i can say that about everi wachovia ( now well fargo ) locat that i 've ever been in . my teller greet me profession enough , help me complet my transact , bid me <unk> , and wish me a good weekend . ( it wa a friday . ) later in the even , i wa surpris to get an <unk> <unk> about my deposit and my withdraw . i immedi check my account onlin and sure enough , there wa a line that said i had made a withdraw in a branch or store . which i knew i had not . and whi would i , when i had deposit cash ? ( the money wa <unk> at the same branch i made my deposit which is whi i am write the review under thi branch . i have anoth issu that happen at anoth branch that i will review under that branch . ) i call the <unk> custom servic line , explain the situat and wa told that the custom servic rep had had a similar call earlier . she then ask me if i knew someon name <unk> <unk> . ( i do not . and even if i did , how would <unk> <unk> withdraw from my account if she is not a joint account holder ? ) <unk> to say the least . while i can not say for sure that my teller wa at fault for thi mishap , she wa the person who access my inform . is it possibl that she did n't close out my file when my transact wa complet , allow further access to my account ? they would n't <unk> that inform which i can understand but do n't appreci . it took the bank a week to <unk> and return the <unk> to my account . thank there were no <unk> due to thi unpleas <unk> . note : thi branch is now a well fargo bank , like the all the former wachovia bank here in charlott .
one of my favourit food place on yong . their signatur udon is realli good and their cocktail menu is a <unk> . atmospher is good insid but it could get pretti pack in the even so it is best to make reserv ahead of time .
i realli do enjoy my time everi time i come here . thi establish remind me of be back east , with it ambianc and vibe . i came here last week for my birthday and with good drink , good food , and good compani , i had a blast ! ! we had the crab dip , fish n chip , and <unk> and mash . all of the food wa quit delici ! what i like most about the open in the crowd . ye , it is in scottsdal , but it 's not scottsdal . the peopl who come here are down to earth , and not the <unk> <unk> pretenti peopl of scottsdal , which i love . when you 're here , you 're famili and everyon is will to talk to everyon . and even the waitstaff is friendli and attent . i wish i could frequent thi place more often but i live rather far away . i will never have a problem if a friend suggest come here for a night of drink ! !
thi is the best pho in chinatown ( and i 've tri them all ! ) . not nearli as rush as the other pho place on <unk> , nor as crowd and loud . price are similar and food is better ! they 're the onli one with seafood soup and i think the onli one that sell egg noodl ( they call them yellow noodl ) along with the standard rice one . great spot for pho in montreal !
we stop in for lunch and we were <unk> surpris . veri clean updat decor , fast friendli and attent servic nice menu and the food wa excel . everyth is made in hous even the fri .
my first time here , wa veri excit , went out with a group of 14 , start off with the waiter ask if anyon want shrimp i said ye , he decid to put out two full plate for the whole tabl , after it wa <unk> up by everyon i find out it wa onli bill to me . veri veri deceiv ! so the shrimp wa not up to par and most of the meat were averag to say the best . the bar wa ok , servic wa not anyth special either . for my like and money i much rather go to ani buffet on the strip the food qualiti is the same and you will save a bunch of cash !
love love my lash ! i get volum and classic mix . super relax and i never have burn that i 've had with other . easi book and avail .
while visit toronto , thi experi wa sort of ice on the cake for us . at 19 were crazi enough to drive to drive the 9 hour ride through the entir state of ny ... pretti much to sit down at a bar and have a drink ! serious , befor we even got there , i did n't even know anyth about the cn tower . i can recal see the structur mile away and quickli had to search to see what that wa . we were also crazi enough to go dure the middl of winter , so we had no wait line at all compar to what other have state . i 'm sure line are much longer dure the spring and summer . noth at all like the 4 hour to see the <unk> state build . within 5 minut of walk in , we were on the elev ( which is partial glass so you watch yourself go up ) and it is veri fast . your ear will pop go up , much like an airlin experi doe , so be prepar . the glass floor is n't the entir floor , but i did n't think it would be . too mani peopl would panic and my partner would n't even go close to it . overal , the cn tower wa a neat experi that i will never forget , and those sort of moment are worth more than the piec of paper it cost me .
great place if you are a chocol lover or crave for some . friendli and quick servic , but a littl prici . great place to chill with friend as the staff do n't rush you or make you feel pressur to leav . mani avail and comfi seat . interest fondu flavour like the earl grey chocol , veri smooth and full of aroma . disappoint that the cup of fondu look a lot bigger than it actual is , veri deceiv as the content is actual onli a few tabl spoon , less than <unk> of the cup . would be a lot better if there is more dip and enough for all the item in the set . their signatur hot chocol is a die for , but quit prici . worth a tri though as you probabl would n't find anyth like it elsewher . it is extrem thick and fill , best to be share . brunch menu on the prici side . the chicken waffl is more like a waffl chicken salad sandwich . fluffi waffl , but noth too special . i prefer the chicken crunch . it is like anoth <unk> , just pricier and more option .
sammi came to my hous nice and earli got my ac fix and readi befor it got to hot out told me what i need veri afford and honest , i will now be call him for all my ac need thank you ! you guy were great ! !

their name say it all ! great place to stop in town , and hand down , the best milk shake for mile around . do n't leav without one !
like i said befor , i am a loyal custom . first i would like to state that my contact , who is `` <unk> '' , doe an excel job alway let me know what item i should be take care of on my <unk> . second , still other than the price an excel job is done when i bring my truck in for routin mainten . the disappoint is , when the vehicl get the complimentari car wash , it come out with water not dri by the <unk> from the car wash . so now when i drive home , becaus i wa not prepar to dri the truck , i get water spot . mayb i should be better prepar and bring me some towel with me to dri off the water befor leav . anyway , good job sand <unk> .
thi wa a dive . i call and wa told a price and then wa charg more plu a $ 20 deposit . then wa charg an addit $ 10 for a nasti old towel i use to clear my dirti shoe that need to be wash . you think for $ 85 for one night at an old dive that had a broken chair a tv that onli had one station and they call to ask if i wa gon na check out or not even though you know when check out is , then go and check the room befor u leav like you were steal the crap that wa there . also the pool wa fill with nasti water the ladi told anoth coupl that normal she would n't let them stay and wait in the lobbi to wait for their taxi but they were lucki it wa rain . thi place should be shut down and never open again . god <unk> if that $ 85 dollar wa n't worth them wash a towel . what a joke . peopl do not stay here .
i read the review and expect more . perhap their friend wrote them , or mayb themselv ? ? i ask for a pedicur by a femal with tip on 2 toe . she did n't know how so i end up with a man , who did a nice job , but , not what i ask for . he spent a huge amount of time rub my leg , not my feet . and 2 day later , the heel is still rough , so again , i expect more . i wa there with a friend who also had a pedicur . when the guy wa done , he got up and did n't even tell her he wa finish . i took longer due to the tip . i wa quot a price for tip on all toe but i onli had 2 tip on each foot . but i wa charg for a full set ! ! ! neither one of us wa impress with the custom servic . not go back . if the technician read thi , you know who you are ...
my new favorit restaur is jac 's . to be fair , the pool of restaur in madison that i can actual eat at ha narrow <unk> of late , due to a <unk> of celiac diseas . the treatment for celiac diseas is a 100 % gluten-fre diet for the rest of my life . unlik someon with a gluten intoler , i can not eat at place where there is a signific risk of cross-contamin , so a lot of madison 's `` gluten-fre '' menu are not <unk> for me , becaus they are not truli gluten-fre . i am in love with jac 's becaus i feel the risk of gluten cross-contamin is realli low , and that make me feel comfort to eat there . first of all , they maintain a dedic fryer for gluten-fre fri item . thi is essenti for me , and is actual , i am find , quit rare . addit , our waitress wa extrem knowledg and seem to take my restrict serious . although she wa `` pretti sure '' that none of the sauc on the menu contain gluten , she check the item we order , specif , to <unk> me , and seem happi to do so . <unk> to gluten , the host wa also awesom . we arriv to a bit of a wait , and he allow us to walk up and down <unk> st. dure our 15 minut wait . he call us when our tabl wa readi . that wa such a nice touch . on to the food . the gluten-fre menu option at jac 's are extens . there are sever menu item with a tini `` g '' next to them . in my <unk> , i initi assum the `` g '' <unk> menu item that were gluten-fre . thi seem more standard , as most place do n't offer that mani gf ( gluten-fre ) option . our waitress inform me , howev , that the tini `` g '' <unk> onli the few menu item that can not be order gf ! that meant that nearli the entir menu wa my oyster ! with so mani choic , it took a while to pick my dish . i final settl on the gf tart <unk> . the tart <unk> wa a flatbread top with jone farm bacon , caramel onion , creme <unk> , rosemari , and parmesan chees . it tast heavenli . i can onli describ the tast as be the same as the <unk> smell of bacon and onion cook togeth ( plu chees ) . it wa so . good . and , the gluten-fre crust wa thin and crisp , and it had no <unk> `` weird '' flavor or textur . we also had gluten-fre frite with four amaz gluten free dip sauc . everyth about it wa incred . although my experi wa awesom , i can anticip it be realli hard to get a tabl at jac 's on a weekend night . we went on a tuesday at around 7pm , and there wa still a wait ! they do n't take reserv on friday , which is disappoint . i will definit dine at jac 's again , and i look forward to write an updat review at some point .
so good ! ! ! we went as a group and everyon love the food they order . the food wa veri reason price ! ! yum !

my experi with parti peopl wa awesom . i see other review say they receiv poor custom servic , but i have know idea what they are talk about . my husband and i got marri in octob of <unk> , and we use parti peopl to suppli tent frame , tabl , chair , <unk> , wooden bench , wooden dine tabl , bistro light , and a <unk> <unk> gener . we had a great experi , as everyth wa deliv on time , pick up on time , and set up and <unk> down veri effici . on top of that , cathi , one of the owner of the busi , wa so help ! my husband plan most of the layout , setup , and logist of the weed . cathi wa will to meet him on saturday and take a lot of time to talk through order form and logist , ensur that the right size and best option for everi detail of the wed were rent and make the wed look perfect ! cathi wa even will to deliv our rental item a day earlier than normal at no extra charg so that we had plenti of time to get everyth setup and decor and not be stress out lead up to the wed . thi wa so differ from a few other compani we had talk with when determin who to get our rental from . the other compani simpli did n't care about us as custom becaus we were n't some larg , corpor account . parti peopl , on the other hand , is a small busi run by a group of <unk> , and they listen to us , work with our vision , and went abov and beyond . i love my experi with parti peopl . i give them a solid 5 star and will be recommend them to anyon i know with ani rental need !
the farmer 's market is the onli good reason to be up earli on a saturday morn . and i do mean earli . i mean , like , 7 <unk> get there much later than that and you have to <unk> with <unk> of slightli <unk> peopl , and a lot more women push stroller that you inevit trip over . do yourself a big favor and stop at the <unk> bakeri tent for <unk> scone and other such pastri . get your cure meat fix at the d & g tent , where incred beef jerki <unk> . hook 's chees is anoth favorit of mine , with mani varieti of age cheddar and jack . there is just so damn much to tast and see and smell . it 's like a parti for the sens , and everyon 's invit .
we were visit scottsdal for a coupl of day and thi place caught my eye ... it wa a good choic ! servic wa fast and the staff wa nice , the food wa great , especi the <unk> salad ! would have given 5 star but the pizza wa pretti basic .
if you have hour to blow come on up ! the slowest store ever . the manag ca n't do sale ! ? it faster to go to anoth store across town .
visit date : <unk> first time here after all the hype around charlott about thi place food & servic : i had the <unk> platter for $ 40 with extra butter sauc . it wa realli good ! ! omg wa it good ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! now i wa gon na eat it the restaur . it wa a veri long wait for my food which i understand . but when i got my food , part of my crab wa cold and the shrimp wa min away from also be cold , i do n't mind wait for my food becaus i know it 's freshli cook but when my food come and it not hot and i have wait 30 min plu for my food that a problem . mind you at that time i wa go to dine in . the waitress took my food back to warm it back up and i ask her to just bag it up to go . the servic to the tabl is a bit slow . i do n't think each servic have certain tabl becaus about 2 to 3 differ <unk> stop it my tabl and ask have someon help ( which is a good thing ) . now would i go back ... ... ye i will hand down ! i have alreadi plan the date lol . hope thing will be better . everyon have off day . insid : it 's pretti big and they have their <unk> on all the tabl . it 's a pretti good vibe . they have a good music play . ye the line are long . when i got there it wa just like 5 peopl ahead of me but when i wa leav ( around <unk> <unk> ) that line wa out the door ! they also have a stage . i wonder if they have <unk> <unk> there sometim ? the process : you pay for your food at front when you walk in ( that whi the line is long like that ) . it would be help if it 's your first time , to look at the menu befor get there , so it will help the line move faster . after you pay , the host will take you to your tabl . then you will get your food . now the food is cook when your order . so keep in mind that it 's not fast food . if you are in a rush you might want to call in your order and get it to go . they will bring your food in a <unk> box ( ye even if you dine in ) . which is cool especi if you do n't eat all your food . <unk> order : ye you still have to stand in that line . but you will go to the bar to <unk> your order .
everyth ha been great the 3 time we have been here . i recommend the <unk> margarita . veri fresh <unk> . excel servic . you ca n't go wrong here .
jesu whi do i get stuck take my friend to these <unk> place ? ! ? ! ? ! do n't get me wrong - i enjoy see hot <unk> ... i 'm a guy for cri out loud ! but damn ... . $ 30 to get in ( i get in free now that i 'm a `` local `` ) place is pack ... .it made me laugh that they had that post sign about the max <unk> ... <unk> peopl ... my buddi and i agre that had to be a joke ... there 's no way it would be safe to allow a thousand peopl in thi place ... if that 's true ... not sure who the <unk> paid but i hope it doe n't bite them in the ass . the ladi - sure most are pretti ... or at least i think so ... the place is so dark ... not sure what a lap danc cost - they have lot of `` <unk> and <unk> `` for privaci ... . drink - i think my beer cost $ 6 or so ? i laugh that my buddi bought a doubl <unk> <unk> with <unk> ( wtf ? ) it cost $ 20 ... <unk> ... i 'm get too old for thi shit ... and the crap i get from my girlfriend ... <unk> ! ! cocktail pleas !
it is extrem impress that oak present us such a fine experi on it 5th night of be open . decor is love ; veri welcom staff ; and servic by <unk> wa impecc . the octopu appet wa the best i have ever had ( includ itali ! ) , and the porterhous and truffl fri were divin . their other restaur , <unk> , is a favorit , as well ; oak is a welcom addit to the <unk> restaur dine scene . i 'm look forward to return , and to their addit soon of a sunday brunch !
thi place is all out awesom ! thi is the second time my partner and i have been here and <unk> immedi recogn us ! she ask where our friend wa and rememb littl thing about our order : ) that 's just to start , the food is delici , it come to you quickli and it is a great atmospher ! well deserv of 5 star !
went here two time with no wait in line ( luckili ) . i do n't mind wait 5 minut or so , but ani longer i would n't want to eat here . i realli like the textur of the noodl here ! super fast servic and portion are satisfi enough to fill you up . i do find the broth here to be more on the salti side , but nonetheless , rich and tasti . if you 're unsur what to order - <unk> is the way to go . i 've also tri the tomato which wa n't too bad either . if you 're near eaton center and crave noodl , thi place is where you should go .
i had an appoint with thi offic and on the day of my appoint i got realli realli sick and could n't make it . i call them right when they open to let them know and the offic girl which wa extrem rude said they will still charg me the <unk> for late cancel ! i told her i could n't physic make it i wa that sick and she said well we will send you collect . horribl custom servic i ca n't believ how they treat their patient . they had no <unk> at all and they are n't will to work with you at all . bewar is all i can say ! they are suppos to help peopl not make them feel wors . i ask the girl so you want me to drive to my appoint be in my current condit and risk get into an accid becaus i 'm sick so i wo n't be charg the <unk> she said no i did n't say that but we are still go to charg you . <unk> ! !
absolut delici . i had fish enchilada that were fill and yummi . my friend had the taco salad . a great place for lunch . small though ... be prepar you may need to take out !
in 2011 , i leas my first mini convert . i love the car . it wa a blast to drive and unless it wa rain , i had to roof down . last week i went to the dealership , as my leas wa near the end . while i would have prefer to get anoth mini convert , due to health challeng , i had to get someth larger and more practic for my need . i met with alexa , who wa great . she found sever vehicl for me to test drive and i end up purchas a <unk> , <unk> vehicl perfect for me . i am not the kind of custom who will sit around for hour play the game of `` let me go ask my manag . '' when i 'm shop for a vehicl i expect the person i 'm deal with to be given the opportun to do what it take without have to run and ask for <unk> . alexa wa profession , enthusiast and knowledg . in a word , fabul . while thi is my second time get a vehicl from mini , it wo n't be my last . so , if you are look to leas or purchas a mini cooper or a <unk> vehicl , i highli recommend mini of la vega on <unk> . and be sure to ask for alexa <unk> . tell her <unk> sent you .
i hate it when it take 15 minut to get a cup of coffe . i hate it when i do n't ever get a second cup of coffe after wait so long to get the first . i hate it when you get <unk> pancak , and they overcook them so they 're hard and crispi . i hate it when place serv you sausag patti that were cook a day or two ago , then reheat ( and complet dri ) for your breakfast . i hate it when your server speak bare enough english to get by . i hate it when breakfast place onli carri sweet and low ( `` they just have the pink kind ? realli ? ? '' ) instead of equal or <unk> . what decad is thi ? thi locat is by far the worst i 've ever been to .
my experi wa dri tough sauc on one side rib and corn on the <unk> wrap in <unk> with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> `` street corn ''
the food is 4 star and the beer is more of a 3.5 . there are day when i 'm starv and wish i could drive the six hour to phoenix and have four peak for lunch . i do n't know whi , but the food there is top for a brewpub . it 's not super gourmet like those particip in thi <unk> <unk> as of late , but it 's solid comfort all the way . i 'm particularli addict to their <unk> chicken tender and their fri ( season wedg ) are like crack . they 've got decent fish and chip ( although they do n't hold a candl to georg and dragon ) and the other stuff 's good too . <unk> , four peak doe n't make the cut on my list of favorit breweri in the countri , but for arizona , it 's okay . the <unk> ( not to be confus with <unk> 's <unk> <unk> ( which rate higher on <unk> ) from california , and the less popular <unk> 's <unk> <unk> from seattl , seem to be their most popular brew and is a pretti standard and consist scotch ale with just the right amount of malt and <unk> . other offer includ their 8th street ale ( averag ) , <unk> ( below averag ) , and their hop <unk> ipa ( which is inconsist -- sometim it 's veri <unk> , sometim it 's just got no bite at all ) . they have a <unk> ipa which is also inconsist -- sometim it ha no differ from the hop <unk> <unk> , but when you do get a <unk> that tast differ , it 's a littl compar to <unk> ' hop stupid . the <unk> stout and pumpkin <unk> are laughabl . just cheap knock off of better breweri , although the stout doe make a decent milkshak . and the arizona peach use to be a summer fave of mine up until i got a pint that tast entir of wheat ... gross . it get pack here , but they 've got ton of space and a decent happi hour . ton of temp local , but worth the visit if you 're in the area . is thi the best local breweri in the greater phoenix area ? of cours ... but there is n't realli much competit , now is there ?
not a bad place to stop on <unk> . there are better place for sushi , but i would go back .
i came here on a tuesday and wa blown away by both the food and servic . everyth from my egg , toast , hash , and bacon were perfectli cook by mari herself . the bread use for the toast wa so delici that i <unk> up think about it the next day . the array of jam and jelli that they serv are pure perfect . in the end , my husband and i end up buy two <unk> ( one raspberri the other <unk> ) to take home with us . there wa onli 1 waitress there that day . she put most big name restaur to shame . she wa sweet , attent , and wa abl to work the whole room ( all fill with local that frequent the place daili ) . i will definit come to eat here again when i am in la vega .
okay so mayb i did danc with one of the waitress next to the <unk> . do n't judg me ! <unk> , the staff is friendli and the <unk> jam will cheer up ani unhappi camper . i <unk> them for that and keep their cool when deal with these obnoxi , <unk> <unk> at all wake hour from all corner and <unk> in which they crawl from ( i <unk> the <unk> ! ) . noth <unk> , just your averag diner with averag food . but , with it be one of the few spot in the <unk> open 24 hour , how can you go wrong ? automat bonu point for that and more bonu point for them serv fri chicken and mac ' n chees <unk> damn day ! can i get an amen ? !

<unk> i order eggplant and tofu , wa clearli old . the eggplant wa straight mush , and the tofu wa so dri and chewi as if it wa fri two week ago and reheat . even my steam rice wa dri with hard old chunk in it . how doe a chines restaur screw up steam rice ? unfortun i wo n't be eat here again .

i usual hike south mountain for trail run , but i came here for the <unk> rock n run . run through the mountain , it 's pretti nice and easi . noth super hard and there seem to see a lot of flat an declin trail . if i live close enough i would run the mountain all the time for train or for fun . i 'd like to see what other trail thi mountain offer . there is a lot of grass and restroom servic area on the base which is alway a plu . not sure if i had to pay for park becaus of the event or if it a regular thing though .

i love <unk> . they are alway super help , will to answer question in depth . ad bonu - they never make you feel bad for not alreadi know about it all . they have a real passion for get beginn involv so they actual want to stick with <unk> . the clinic they host are veri inform and it 's great that they have such a varieti of them . my favorit person to talk to is <unk> at the ray store . he know hi stuff and alway make me feel like i 'm part of the <unk> circl .
somewhat reason , food could be better but is better than anyth i 've found or sampl in the sound area with except of <unk> . chang 's . appear to be busi everi time i 've stop by and i understand they deliv too .
i wish it wa an option for no star . the absolut worst experi i 've ever had . manag doe n't care that your not happi with servic . i wa forc to pay 80 dollar for 2 piec of meat . i wa by pass continu by waiter and did not receiv qualiti servic , compar to the tabl of white diner sit behind me . in the sever defens some peopl in my parti had alreadi close out , but they are suppos to check for the green flip card . i wa serv 2 piec of meat in 2 hr . i wa offer the same meat four time . i came with intent of eat a full meal , and left hungri after spend <unk> at thi restaur . worst experi of my life . spoke with everi member of manag to tri and <unk> the situat . not even an apolog , but instead they inform me that they could n't tell how mani piec of meat i ate . petti manag and petti practic . wa treat like a run a way <unk> and call a liar . no respect or fuck were given and no reason solut were offer . onc told manag the truth about how i felt and noth wa done . i wa a man of my word , the check wa <unk> , i paid 80 dollar onli becaus i wa be forc to stay insid the restaur and i did n't want problem . i told the manag to hi face that i no longer want to be in the restaur after receiv such horribl servic . they want me to stay longer and finish my meal , but whi would i when the servic wa alreadi horribl . forgot to mention the 40 min wait for the mix drink we order as soon as we got to the tabl . we will be contact the corpor offic on monday morn .

first , kim is a credit to labcorp . i have been to thi locat a number of time and find her to be thorough , effici , knowledg and friendli . i went to a differ labcorp locat ( spring valley hospit ) recent and it wa much busier , and the attend seem to hate their job . the person who wa help me at that locat wa not friendli and seem annoy about everyth . at spring valley , they seem <unk> on get peopl away from the desk as quickli as possibl -- question are an annoy -- and everi answer is follow by pleas have a seat and we 'll call you up . as it turn out the comput wa tell the attend i wa not elig , which she could n't explain . i have insur coverag and labcorp is within my network so that wa a confus situat . after hear that , i ask what the test would cost -- just a <unk> -- if i had to pay for them and she realli could n't say . i wo n't go back to the spring valley hospit locat . i took the paperwork and made an appoint at west <unk> instead . kim wa so on the ball , she notic the spring valley attend had miss the code for one of the test i wa suppos to have . as it turn out , there wa no `` not elig '' warn via the comput system and there wa just one other person wait for a test . ( thi locat open earli and close about 2 <unk> , i believ . the first time i went to thi locat , i must admit it wa a littl strang that there is no extra employe to handl `` <unk> '' , while the other do blood draw . so , kim and the other employe will input all the inform , take credit info , confirm address , etc . and then call you up to also <unk> the blood draw . i imagin it 's labcorp way to make more money by have employe do more than one job -- not necessarili do it in the <unk> way for the custom 's benefit .
i would marri big shot bob if he would have me . hi employe are alway help when i have question about all their wing flavor . the portion are gener . the price are right . the food is alway a treat . i 've had sever differ wing flavor , some of the sandwich includ the sloppi joe , grill chees and blt and i 've never been disappoint . also , they have tater tot ! ! if my heart and stomach would let me , i would probabl eat here more often . i ca n't recommend thi place enough .

<unk> avec <unk> au petit café de <unk> ? mai , <unk> ! <unk> la la , le petit <unk> cafe , <unk> <unk> . pictur thi : a warm spring even with occasion rain , my date and i enter a warm , tini french cafe and suddenli i am no longer in cleveland , but pari . <unk> , our server wa <unk> . she made excel suggest and wa attent , but not <unk> . we start with a `` happi hour '' special of sangria . summer = sangria . <unk> . then for <unk> we enjoy a wonder chees plate , which is a great bang for your buck , and <unk> which were perfectli prepar . avec le <unk> we enjoy a wonder bottl of wine . both of our main cours select were bon . the quantiti of food for the price is excel . dessert wa a nutella crepe and espresso . my date and i were not overwhelm by the crepe . thi is my one complaint . it wa a bit thick for what i consid a crepe . not terribl , just not <unk> . the espresso wa nice and <unk> , it came with la <unk> de <unk> ! there is a quaint patio which i imagin i will frequent for an even bottl of wine and chees plate , or a croissant and cafe au <unk> on sunday morn . le petit <unk> is a beauti venu for a date . take your <unk> here .

i order a petit filet mignon , and my partner order <unk> sea bass with spinach , and we share a side order of asparagu . the entre and asparagu were nice prepar and tasti , but my steak definit wa not tender . ( tasti , ye , tender , no ) servic wa excel and the atmospher wa quiet , pleasant , and classi . fleme 's is pricier than prici though and not realli worth what you pay for . think `` meat on a plate '' with zero <unk> . with no appet , no alcohol , no dessert , and a singl share side dish , our meal came to just south of $ 200 .
so i have n't been here in over 3 year and went here with a group of friend . call saturday and they got my group of 7 in a small both . wa expect it to be too small but definit had enough room ! <unk> wa great and they had a buy 2 get 1 deal . we also had <unk> drink and they definit got the night go . so i wa realli happi with the servic , from the host that setup our over the phone reserv , to the attent of the staff . justin wa fantast , veri fast in get us our drink and help work the karaok machin . overal wa a great time with local friend . i highli recommend <unk> becaus of the servic . i work in the servic industri and i can say that the staff tonight were great ! ! <unk>
thi wa my favorit korean fri chicken <unk> had great servic on top of it as well . howev , i just found out thi place close down . for ani of you wonder whi they do n't answer their phone , it is becaus they close down ... sad day
there wa a long wait . accord to other review , that 's appar alway true . as an appet , i paid $ 4 for a coupl of egg roll that were about four inch long and the <unk> of a <unk> . come on now , realli . the miso soup and the cucumb salad appet were about $ <unk> each , i observ those portion were much better match to the price . the ayc deal at yama sushi wa a few buck cheaper than sushi <unk> about <unk> mile up the street , but sushi <unk> wa somewhat better qualiti , and the servic wa a <unk> bit more attent . pho kim long is just a few door away in the same strip mall as yama sushi . no <unk> sushi at pho kim long , of cours , but the product is much higher qualiti , a nice meal , with gener portion , and you 'll get out easili for the same price . i 'd take either of those place again befor yama sushi . but pho kim long is the best choic of the three , by far . guess i 'm just not realli down for these <unk> ayc sushi <unk> <unk> joint .
wonder <unk> and fun beer and wine list along with an open nice patio . servic wa <unk> and my 3 cours worth mani return . i hope to be in cleveland again so i may return to <unk> kitchen . i drank and ipa and 2 tasti <unk> . the soup wa massiv , vegan and fill with flavor . i wrote note on the warm salad hope to <unk> it at home and the udon noodl bowl as tasti and most japanes restaur .
as soon as i walk in i could smell the pretenti attitud <unk> all around . i walk in here for the first time with sever of my friend after wait in line for a short time . the place look nice . drink are pricey . whatev . it wa n't that big of a deal , but then ... but then ... the owner walk up to me and say i can not use my vape indoor . <unk> <unk>
absolut horribl custom servic . sign say lunch end at 3 and they did n't want to let us in at <unk> . talk about fals advertis ! been come here for 4 year and thi place use to be awesom but everi time i come in it 's gotten wors and wors . too bad cuz the sushi is awesom but manag is horribl ! stupid manag ca n't even speak english properli !

we order the fish basket and lobster <unk> the lobster roll wa ridicul small and tast veri bland , definit not worth <unk> the fish basket wa decent but noth special about it !
thi is almost the same as tea time - with the same owner and same employe . i do like the drink sinc they 're nearli the same as the origin one , but i do n't like how they took out the <unk> snack becaus the spam musubi and <unk> fri were bomb . the place is quiet and relax itself with a modern interior and an instrument playlist so if you ever want to get work done or want to <unk> then i realli recommend .

i realli want to like corbeaux . i have visit mayb onc everi month and a half sinc it open on 17th . the concept is nice ( and so 's the massiv <unk> pour natur light over the tabl and wall ) but at the same time it 's all over the place . i visit 17th ave a lot and the build 's exterior is pretti <unk> ; it <unk> is reflect insid the build , but is taken advantag of pretti terribl . the layout itself is confus , with dine tabl on one side of a <unk> and a counter where you can order bake good . i 'm never sure where you 're allow to sit , so it kind of defeat the purpos of tri to blend the line between an <unk> hangout place and a formal dine experi . i might tri have dinner there one day , but i do n't know - it never realli appeal to me as a restaur , so i never think about go there <unk> for a sit-down meal . if you go to corbeaux to studi , you 're basic <unk> to the stool by the window , which is not actual the best feel , even though it 's basic the same thing as <unk> . the first few time i went when it open , it seem like a <unk> oper , tri to find it 's feet - the cashier by the bake good were inexperienc and it took forev just to get a chocol eclair . have the cashier also handl all of the retriev , <unk> and <unk> all while manag the till is realli <unk> and it definit make you feel <unk> just watch . though the eclair itself wa good , i do n't get a <unk> for sweet and their sandwich often enough to go regularli . i do n't think corbeaux is the coolest thing that ever wa - the execut is actual quit confus and i have no idea what the <unk> at the back are for . it just seem like a lot of wast space and it could be more <unk> . in term of the food i 've tri , the cooki were okay , but did n't seem that fresh . i like eggplant , so got an eggplant sandwich . it wa veri oili , leak all over my hand and wa definit <unk> when i had to get up from my stool and walk straight up to the cashier to tri to find paper napkin . they were pretti <unk> about that ( i 'm <unk> ? ? ? ? my hand are cover in oil someon help ) . the sweet are high qualiti , macaroon slightli disappoint ... but overal , just not a phenomen experi for what it appear to offer .
do not order food ! my husband and i went with two other coupl and we were all look forward to be abl to have a meal and drink some drink all while watch a movi in some comfi seat . we all left disappoint and said we would n't go back . first , the movi did n't start on time . not too big of a deal becaus there were no <unk> , but that wa just the begin of the downfal . second , we order our food at <unk> . by <unk> , my husband and i were still wait on our glass of water and food . by thi time the other peopl we came with had alreadi finish their food , which came to them cold . by 9:00 , after repeat what we had order , our food arriv . we were lucki that it came warm . about 30 min after that we were brought our food again ... <unk> then , as the credit roll , a server came dash up the stair to bring us yet anoth order . it wa crazi . one person from our group notic that the same server for our theater were also work all the other theater too ! ! it 's no wonder whi food wa late and cold ! lastli , the girl bathroom wa so gross . the trash wa spill out the top of the garbag hole in the counter . some of the stall had zero toilet paper ! in conclus , if you are look to have dinner and a movi , do n't . eat befor or after the movi , unless you 're cool pay for over price , cold food . thi place need better manag if it intend to stay in busi .
i have been come here for a few year now and have alway been overli satisfi with the <unk> and attent to detail . i have taken numer dress shoe and boot for <unk> and overal <unk> and have never been disappoint . here is a latest exampl of a pair of <unk> & murphi <unk> 's where they did a half <unk> - wish i had a befor pictur as they were look like they were on their last leg , and now look brand new . <unk> & murphi at fashion squar doe not do shoe servic anymor , they simpli recommend thi store ! great proof of their <unk> .

focaccia sandwich are a must have . like serious ... get it . and do n't split it . me and my friend made thi mistak . do n't do it . it 's also a veri reason price for thi amaz , oili , fluffi delici sandwich . we got the onli vegetarian varieti ( sorri forgot the name ) - and it wa honestli bomb . as for other thing , my friend got the angel hair pasta ( ~ $ 16 ) and i got the babi octopu ( ~ $ 14 i think ) . the portion were pretti small , but my babi octopu wa veri fresh and flavour . my friend enjoy her pasta but thought it wa quit oili ( especi sinc our sandwich wa pretti much <unk> in oil as well <unk> ) . to be honest , we both kinda wish we just got two sandwich ... caus they were that good . lastli the servic wa great , the waiter wa perfectli attent and the ambianc wa nice wa well . overal i 'd say 4.5
i usual do not do a review the first time i visit but thi place is except delici . it ha n't offici open but you can stop by and get yourself a quick bite . if you 're familiar with the boba hut then you 'll love curri hut . food is great , atmospher is invit and price are reason .
i wa realli impress with thi place . it 's right around the corner , which mean i can pop over ani time i need a new pair of shoe , and i receiv awesom servic the day i went . i wa shop around for a new shoe ... i 've tri a few pair over the past year but had n't found anyth i realli like . i wa the onli custom in the store , and the sale guy put me on the treadmil and did a quick <unk> <unk> , which wa veri help . he <unk> out a whole line of shoe for my <unk> and encourag me to take them out for a run on the <unk> sinc i 'm mostli an outdoor runner . i end up find a great shoe ( <unk> gel <unk> 6 ) and have love run in it for the past few week . the price seem a littl more than i would pay onlin or at a larger retail , but i think it 's worth it for the servic . after all , now that i 've found a shoe i realli like , i can just order it onlin from now on .
when one see the name <unk> chines cuisin , one expect to walk into a restaur full of <unk> , otherwis whi own a name like that ? we went there on a weeknight and natur it wa probabl a littl bit more quiet than usual . there were onli ten tabl that i could see that were occupi so find a seat that even wa n't a problem at all . we want to tri some of their more delic dish so we went with their <unk> duck skin and wrap , a stir fri lobster with ginger , steam babi bok choy and shrimp mix with tofu and egg white sauc . tradit the <unk> duck will alway arriv first as they will skin the duck in front of you and that it is often use as an appet the duck skin wa crispi and the duck meat wa marin well and had just the right amount of fat in it . the wrap were hot and plenti as no extra wrap were need . the rest of the duck meat wa dice and brought back out so that it could be use as the main ingredi for the wrap . the tradit use of <unk> sauc and green onion along with their cabbag wrap made thi a much more enjoy dish to have . the lobster wa compar to it competitor . the meat wa tender and the sauc wa abl to <unk> into the meat make all the lobster meat succul and delici . the two veget and <unk> dish were simpl , tasti and were a good compliment with all the meat dish that we had order that even . despit the amount of egg white sauc in the latter dish , the shrimp remain tender and fresh . overal , the dish were all pretti good . the dish were fresh , color and plenti to go all the way around . staff wa alway by our side although that could have been the fact that it wa a quiet weeknight at the restaur . price were reason for the qualiti of the food that wa present . dim sum i 'm told is pretti good here so the next time i visit , we will tri some dim sum at thi place and report back to you . dinner overal wa <unk> with plenti of smile all around the tabl .

i love come to gordon squar , and i previous consid thi to be a pretti good option for cheaper eat in the area . we 've <unk> up some pretti decent food here befor - one of the first time i had chicken and waffl wa at <unk> , and i still rememb argu with my husband becaus he wa the one that order it and i wa eat too much of hi meal . good food is worth argu about , right ? after our last visit , i do n't know what to think ! their price have gone up ( the chicken and waffl wa definit not $ <unk> last time we had it ) and i guess they just decid they were too cool for salt and pepper . i had <unk> squash gnocchi which wa suppos to be in a brown butter sauc top with parmesan . the dumpl were chewi and flavorless , and appear to have just been roll in some oliv oil . no chees ... no noth . i want to ask our waiter if i could get some chees but he never stop long enough at our tabl for me to mention it . my husband also got grit as a side and again , complet bland . chees is one of the thing i wake up for everi day , so the lack of it on my pasta and in the grit serious bum me out . my sister order their fri broccoli appet , which wa pretti tasti , although they do n't cut up the broccoli <unk> at all beforehand so some of the batter between <unk> doe n't end up get cook . they offer a lot of drink special depend on the day . befor 7 on weekday they have a few draft beer for $ 3 ( when we went it wa rebel ipa , <unk> milk stout and brooklyn lager ) . a pretti good deal for decent beer , but our brooklyn lager tast a bit off . like not clean tap line . sad . anyway , i know thi place ha potenti so i 'm not about to give up on it , but my expect are definit lower now !

did n't have the best visit in here today . two star for the <unk> american gentleman work the counter and the assist manag my fiancé spoke to after i had an issu with a return they were both polit and understand . when i have a receipt for my purchas and the bank card that match the origin purchas i find it veri uncomfort and a privaci violat to ask for my <unk> . thi wa n't just a glanc but a full on write inform down , studi my id like a <unk> , then take my person inform and type it all in to their system . for an 11 dollar return that i had the origin receipt for as well as the debit card it wa purchas on . if i did n't have a receipt or had 100 dollar worth of product then i would understand . cashier had a `` that 's the way it is '' attitud and could n't give me a clear explan of whi she wa do what she wa . dure the phone call with manag on duti she wa at least abl to explain it to us and how it wa a corpor <unk> on the store . i accept the explan but still do n't agre with the practic . thi is the onli store we have had thi happen at so not sure what that mean .
when they do it right thi place ha the best bagel in the area , unfortun they frequent miss the mark . qualiti is hit and miss , some morn the bagel are terribl and some morn they are simpli stellar . cap ha a great dough recip and a decent boil and bake kitchen , the owner need to hire someon who care about qualiti and servic to build thi busi . up until a few month ago i recommend thi place to anyon who thought that <unk> sold a good bagel , now i ca n't recommend it at all . if you need a bagel go to <unk> .
echo & rig is one of those restaur that doe n't get as much attent as it deserv . they are locat in <unk> villag here in summerlin . yet for some reason when i tell peopl that actual live in the area about echo , they say thing like `` did it just open '' or they 'll ask `` is it brand new '' which alway make me wonder what kind of advertis they do if ani . anyway thi place is fun . they have a nice atmospher , a good crowd and are alway consist . ok thing to tri : start with the cauliflow it 's prepar with chili de <unk> , crispi <unk> & onion . they are veri good . i also like the brussel sprout which are made with pistachio & fresh lemon . for fish entré you must tri two . first the organ king salmon made with carrot pure , <unk> spinach , garlic , lemon and oliv oil . second is the horseradish crust <unk> with roast root veget & <unk> pinot sauc both are veri good but the <unk> is my top pick . now for the meat . i would say you ca n't go wrong with ani but my three pic are the spencer steak , the filet <unk> and lastli my favorit the jump beef which is made with filet mignon tip , roast tomato , red onion , crispi potato & <unk> <unk> , veri good . no matter what you choos it 'll be good they are do a good job . if you are a summerlin local and have n't been , then hop over to <unk> and step into echo & rig for a bite !
my husband and i took our middl age <unk> out for a late afternoon of happi <unk> thi week with no particular plan or place in mind . <unk> 's look just about right so we <unk> in and were seat at a tabl on the patio . our server wa prompt and courteou . order off the happi hour menu , everyth wa four <unk> . we onli had a coupl of beer , glass of wine and two app . might tri it for dinner , but other yelp review paint a complet differ pictur for even festiv which may not be our cup of <unk> . also have to agre with other review about smoker on the deck . there were eight peopl on the deck while we were out there and half were smoke . <unk> .
i wa n't super impress with anyth here . food : food wa good but pretti basic . i got the big cheesi melt and two taco . servic : first when we walk up there wa no host . i think the person that sat us wa <unk> <unk> at the time . kind of odd . our server check in about the right amount . tabl over from us got upset that they were n't get their check fast enough . someon at the host desk ( some guy ) later came over and start <unk> the bar staff from the host tabl . mean - yell over to them from about 20 feet away about how they were n't work . super unprofession and awkward and i honestli wa wait for <unk> <unk> of bar rescu to pop out of a corner and start yell at peopl about how unprofession they were be and how uncomfort they were make their guest . drink : fianc order the frozen margarita flight and i order the la <unk> signatur margarita that wa said to be serv in a special bowl and made <unk> . her flight wa good . she said it wa too strong but i like them a lot . she still drank them all . lol . my margarita wa sub-par . my fianc also point out that it said on the menu that they made it at your tabl - they did not do that . flavor of thi margarita wa veri <unk> and certainli noth special . for be the most expens margarita on their menu ... it wa a huge disappoint . verdict : there are far better taco joint within a 2 mile <unk> that you can go to and enjoy better servic , food , and drink .
veri disappoint , we just walk out . 10 minut wait and you ca n't even get someon to stop and get drink order . food might be good servic not so much . plenti to eat nearbi .
what is thi magic place ? ! in la vega , i feel food is not great everywher - especi if you 're look for someth afford . around midnight , <unk> noodl wa my <unk> when i wa look for a <unk> dish . you know , the dish that help <unk> one 's soul up after a long day of day drink , greasi food and tan -- and/or lose your life save on a slot machin . whatev the reason , <unk> noodl have fresh udon . they have tradit dish and fusion dish . the fusion dish are one that <unk> ingredi like kim <unk> or chees that are n't typic found in japanes udon dish . i thought the food wa veri tasti and afford . it is outsid the strip and two plaza away from the palm resort . howev , i enjoy my find .

realli good made to order sandwich ! basic , fresh , and <unk> . the beef samosa are perfect for a snack . staff are veri friendli , especi the owner . if they had a few other side for lunch , the seat area would be a bit more invit .

i have 3 word for you : garlic feta fri . these fri are easili 5 star . they are <unk> , cheesi and <unk> ' delici . their gyro , hummu , pita and gyro salad are excel too but i come back for the fri . the dine room is small and there 's no public restroom for custom . servic is somewher just below friendli .
just recent move back to thi side of town so need to find a new groomer . so glad to have found a great one nearbi ! i call & wa easili abl to schedul an appoint . the ladi on the phone wa veri friendli . the shop itself is kind of tuck away in the walmart shop plaza , so it 's away from all the busi . the decor is cute & modern . as i walk in i wa immedi greet . the groomer ( i forgot to ask her name ) wa veri friendli & ask what i want for <unk> . i show her a pic & told her the length of the cut . i wa n't expect her to be abl to <unk> the look 100 % but she exceed my expect ! so happi with the way my fur babi look ! also , she wa done in about 3 hour which wa the estim time she gave me so that is anoth plu . definit recommend thi shop if you 're on the north west side of town look for a new groomer ! : )
i came here for dinner and to watch the <unk> all star game . the restaur boast a modern and live atmospher . there is a larg fireplac in one corner , and a patio that wrap around the front of the restaur , so i can see that thi place ha the potenti to be a happen place , particularli in the summer time . our server wa veri understand to my <unk> request to get the game on the screen , so i wa veri appreci of that . i wa told they were have `` tv issu '' as the channel would chang <unk> throughout the night , and they were not abl to turn on close <unk> . i wa disappoint but nonetheless our server wa friendli and attent to my request . the food wa good , noth amaz , and i would consid the price point to be high for the type and qualiti of food . thi place remind me of earl 's or <unk> 's , a trendi place , with food that is noth to write home about . servic wa realli what made my experi enjoy . we end up leav at half time to enjoy the game at home instead .
i love that thi place celebr and highlight the <unk> of ube . i also appreci the friendli servic as well as the fact that the product are not too sweet ! i look forward to see more product on their menu . sinc they just open , the place could still use some improv such as a door sign , tabl napkin . i like the ube <unk> cupcak ; it wa kinda dens but wa good . the ube <unk> wa just okay , i would have like it to have more ube flavor .
a typic starbuck . went here on a saturday morn around <unk> ... hung around for about an hour , there wa a <unk> line . thi locat is definit a busi one , but the wait is n't terribl and they keep peopl move . we were a group of 7 , each with a drink and some sort of <unk> . i appreci the barista at the regist , who wa friendli , help , and patient with us and our long order . 30 min later when i went back in line to order someth els , he still rememb my name , nice ! so our drink were starbuck standard , i order an ice <unk> green tea and a <unk> sandwich . the sandwich wa heat nice , the chees melt ... it had bacon but still tast light , and not too heavi . my kid enjoy a toast bagel with cream chees . a littl messi though , probabl becaus of the heavi traffic ... but whi wa the outsid of the food display <unk> <unk> ? ! like a good layer of dust , realli . it 's veri notic , and thick enough to assum that it 's been there for a while ... i also assum that it 's on their `` to do '' list , to wipe down counter and display window . a few tabl and chair to sit at . not realli the best place to go on a saturday morn if you want some peac and quiet or are in a hurri !
servic wa good and beer wa pretti good too . the bar itself wa n't anyth special , though , at least not when we were there . it wa realli hot for whatev reason , even on a cool night with the window open .
<unk> here 's a littl secret about <unk> . not sure whi the last review left a singl star for thi <unk> water hole . i have to <unk> peopl here are amaz . it basic an <unk> cheer . where everyon know everyon . good peopl great atmospher especi for the dart <unk> . food must tri ! ! ! the wing in thi place beat ani wing joint i 've been to . they will mix thing up for ya . howev you want it . my lip enjoy a mix of <unk> garlic ranch and parm style wing . let my <unk> fatti tell you ! ! ! ! nom nom to the nom . so he damn good . if you want sammi with a kick tri the bobbi shannon . chicken sammi with heat ! ! basic , come in for great food and peopl . o yeah if your just hungri and have to <unk> there 's a drive thru ! ! <unk> i said it drive <unk> <unk> said .
great place to have amaz <unk> . no head rush , clean fresh flavour . food is great too . too long of a line up so have to wait atleast 30 minut everi time .
we were anticip when thi place would open . while in the area , we went <unk> yay ! it 's like a spaciou <unk> version of <unk> and game stop mix togeth ( smaller than <unk> record ) . they have game , game accessori , blu ray dvd , regular dvd , music cd , and vh <unk> got ta tell my <unk> sinc she just ask us yesterday about what she should do with all those 100 of vh tape . they pay $ 1.00 for each tape with the case in perfect condit . on the cd , it 's whatev the comput say is the current market valu ( kinda like <unk> except they also add the media mail rate into the total price that they pay ; so strict , the case have to be <unk> ) . my husband wa like , `` whi did we go in here ? '' he saw sever thing that he want to buy but settl on a game for $ <unk> . ( we had more stop to make . ) i thought that the price on the blu ray wa actual pretti <unk> $ <unk> to $ <unk> ( the newer one cost more , which make sens to me ) . we 're alway search for new blu ray to add to our collect . plu we have a few in mind that we want to `` replac '' ( we have them in regular dvd format , but we want to upgrad to blu ray ) . i notic that some vh tape were at <unk> for 25 cent each . the vh section is compris of two small section . i did n't realli look at the regular dvd and cd . there were three peopl ( two <unk> type & one <unk> type ) work there . one man the regist , one veri busi with more <unk> sort ( stack & stack ) , and one in back ? ; mayb on a break as there wa onli one other custom besid <unk> it wa n't busi at all . <unk> , there is a sign in front of the ( cashier ) counter explain their <unk> process , howev , there are a lot of row of dvd block what you are suppos to read . <unk> , they should 've gotten anoth rack or two for those dvd , as they clearli have enough space to accommod the rack . it would be nice if there wa music on- it wa realli quiet . look like we 're come back next week . and we might sell some stuff like cd ( we were gon na do it anyway , through <unk> thi would save us a trip to the post offic ) and video game . it 's nice to know that we have more option than <unk> , target , <unk> , best buy and game stop . hope it 's success .
my sister wa veri excit to eat at <unk> 's for her 30th birthday . we call ahead to make the reserv and were told she would get a dessert for her birthday . we order a few <unk> to start our meal and were disappoint in all of them . we then had our main cours includ the salmon and roast chicken ( <unk> other meal ) , but unfortun were again veri disappoint with the bland and dri flavor . the end of the meal came and we were present with dessert menu and my sister birthday wa not mention or celebr . it wa disappoint overal sinc we were all veri excit but end up spend a lot of money on overpr , underwhelm food .
so i 've been come here almost daili for quit awhil becaus i wa tire of the long line at starbuck . now i 'm start to feel it wa a mistak . one thing starbuck excel at is consist . thi locat , on the other hand , serv a <unk> drink each time i come . it seem to depend on who 's work that day but i 'm get to the point to where my $ 15 a day might be more appreci <unk> els . what <unk> me most is when i ask how the espresso is prepar for an ice latt i wa given some `` made up '' respons meant to <unk> the averag custom . what they do n't understand is that when you 've been drink the same thing for twenti year you know exactli how it 's suppos to tast . even better , the reason i 'm write thi now is becaus they mess up the order again so i 'm kill time while wait for it to be correct . note : make sure you check your food order befor leav the drive-thru . updat : charg twice for soy : (
i wish i had read the review befor go to these con artist . i took my daughter here after go to a <unk> ' dentist that scare her so i thought <unk> she would be happier with a kid specialti dentist . the first appoint went fine , we knew she need two fill so i agre to the extra $ 70 for the laugh ga to make her more comfort . she breez right through it and wa all smile at the end . i wa not smile when they brought her out and i realiz they had given her a silver cap on a <unk> tooth ! she look like a <unk> ! it 's aw ! my daughter is five and thrill she ha a shini tooth <unk> <unk> they did n't even ask me . the second appoint wa where the troubl began . they kept her in the dentist chair for almost an hour befor even start on anyth , i wa nervou that thi would make thing go badli and i wa right . she start freak out befor they were done so they had to put a <unk> fill in until she could come back . that 's when i paid $ <unk> of the $ <unk> the visit wa suppos to cost and wa inform the next visit would cost me $ 900 . what the what ? ! ! ! it get better ! the $ 900 is $ <unk> to <unk> her after they give her the <unk> of <unk> to relax her , then anoth $ 70 for the laugh ga , then $ <unk> to replac the silver <unk> <unk> tooth cap with a white one ( which i wa alreadi charg over $ 100 for the first time ) . and then the $ 30 for the actual work they would be complet . i told them they were insan and they said they would have someon call me . they never did , and now my kid ha a <unk> fill that i have to decid who i can trust to fix and not 1. scare my daughter or <unk> <unk> me blind .
i 'm base my review on my recent visit to the appl store , which , <unk> , wa n't my first visit . i stop by yesterday and as luck would have it , the store wa n't <unk> with peopl whose uniqu reason for be there is to play with iphon and <unk> they 're never go to buy . that meant that i could actual have a convers with someon regard the iphon that i plan to purchas in the near futur , without be push and <unk> . woohoo ! i think i realli luck out becaus <unk> ( the appl employe i spoke to ) wa amaz . she wa super enthusiast and took the time to answer all my question as well as to offer suggest and tip base on her own experi and knowledg . i did tell her upfront that i wa n't look to buy the phone that day , but that chang absolut noth - i receiv a high level of servic and despit employe not be on <unk> , i 'll definit be look for <unk> when i do go back to buy my phone . while the appl store is usual pretti well staf , i think that the level of servic that you receiv can be hit or miss . when i bought my <unk> pro , the guy who `` took care '' of me did absolut <unk> for me other than call up my order . consid the cost of that purchas , i 'd expect amaz servic but that wa n't the case . thi wa 3 year ago so perhap that guy 's not work there anymor ! i would suggest go shortli after the store open to avoid the crowd . thi way you can take your time and get all your question answer without feel rush .
went to vega for my <unk> 's 21st birthday . 5 of us went and start at <unk> ugli , went to <unk> , <unk> and end up at <unk> . it wa a great time . one flat rate and we <unk> all the line and didnt have to pay cover charg . <unk> wa the best host ever ! we had a blast !
sushi is made the `` lazi '' way . instead of cut the cucumb into small strip for the roll , it is just one big chunk , which make it crunchi . some peopl may like it that way , but i do n't . i also order the <unk> ( fatti tuna ) and got regular old tuna , but charg almost $ 10 for it . i hate liar who fals advertis on the menu . the salmon wa good , though .
wa veri excit to go to their tuesday night $ 15 buffet . though they have gluten free , vegan , and vegetarian gravi , their top are <unk> and wa not <unk> for me to eat as a vegetarian . i wa disappoint and thought it wa question for a poutin place to have thing <unk> mix . food : i got their larg poutin with thick cut fri , onion , green pepper , and mushroom . i wa pretti full and ate the rest of a friend 's dish ( i can eat a lot ) . <unk> : the server were friendli but confus . we were seat at the back and i could bare see what i wa eat , i had to use my cell phone light to get a closer look . overal : i 'd come here again for their regular poutin . i 'm disappoint that their ayc is not as <unk> friendli as their gravi .
all <unk> joint are not creat equal . one of my client suggest thi place to me and i am glad i listen to him . the restaur is easili access from almost anywher in the citi and there is ampl lot and street park . they have an extens menu , with <unk> and other chines delight . servic is fast and friendli , the <unk> is contemporari , invit and clean and the food here is veri fresh and flavor and the portion are gener .
do yourself a favor and if you are go to la vega and want to go to the grand canyon , call an enterpris off of the strip and have them pick you up at the hotel and drive yourself there via <unk> like i end up do . everyth about thi compani wa a nightmar . like other review state , they did heard us like <unk> . we got pick up at <unk> ( had been up sinc 4:30 to be readi ) . they screw up the hotel where they were pick other peopl up at and which result in us have to make more stop than necessari and we end up be the last bu to the termin to check in . stood in line to check in for about 40 min and final got assign a bu ( at mayb <unk> ) . <unk> , that bu broke down around <unk> and we were stuck outsid the hoover dam for almost two hour . i liter had a nervou <unk> . it wa the last day of my extrem short vacat be ruin by thi compani . i end up find an enterpris in <unk> citi and they actual came and pick us up . the car wa onli $ <unk> includ mileag . sure i paid $ 100 for ga <unk> grand canyon nation park , but it cost me $ 160 for the bu anyway ( for two of us ) so the price wa exactli the same . i call the compani to say i want a refund and they told me i sign a <unk> against mechan failur ... realli ? ! the onli thing i sign wa a list of name that they told me to sign next to my name to say i wa check in . they never said anyth about a <unk> nor did i read ani materi have to do with <unk> <unk> due to mechan issu . complet and <unk> <unk> ! worst . compani . ever !
food qualiti is so-so , unless you are chines and they somehow make the qualiti slightli better . none of the waiter were born with smile muscl . put it <unk> , they are rude . thi seem to be the <unk> with chines waiter . they have no manner . custom are give them busi and support their <unk> . the least they could do is be courteou and smile . thi is <unk> to american waiter that are gener more <unk> . believ me , you get treat better at mcdonald 's . last but not least , the rest room <unk> , as is the case with most chines restaur . do n't chines have proper <unk> ?
i wish thi place wa back home in <unk> , <unk> ! best food and servic by back and <unk> ! ! we will be `` back '' ; ) get the <unk> ! ! ! ! ! ! !
omg . best burger of my life ! ! ! i had the french onion burger ( without a bun becaus i am gluten intoler . ) the sauc on the burger wa phenomen . i could have eaten a lot more than what they gave me ! my husband got the pig dip sandwich and it wa huge ! he said it wa absolut amaz . the fingerl potato appet is also so good with crispi fri potato and aioli . perfect . if you go dure happi hour the burger and a coupl other dish are a few dollar cheaper . the bar is a realli fun place to sit and enjoy the weather with an amaz list of drink . definit make a reserv if you are go on the weekend . go tri the burger and love it ! ! i love st. <unk> and i ca n't wait to go back !
i came here last week to grab a coffe and a sandwich at the starbuck . befor i went it , i stop by the restroom . let me tell you , these were quit possibl the worst maintain restroom i 've ever seen in a commerci chain like walmart , target , <unk> , smith 's , <unk> . <unk> <unk> all over the floor , paper towel everywher , and stand water just everywher . the cherri on top wa that i found open <unk> needl in the rail of the stall in thi bathroom ! ! serious , i did n't take ani pictur becaus i just had to get out of thi bathroom ! ! i alert the custom servic repres , who did seem genuin concern , and left the store . i will never be return to thi target .
i wa first time custom wa quot $ <unk> for work to be done by <unk> 's auto for front left wheel bear and we check around and paid under $ <unk> for the wheel bear , rear brake , oil chang , and brake light .

heard about thi place from my daughter . she wa right , great food , great servic , i 'll be back !
same famou hamburg and fri as all the other wendi 's . howev , thi locat ha had more issu with <unk> than ani other one that i have been to . mani time i 've come by for lunch and the drive-thru is pack and not move . then i go insid and it 's the same thing . onc i roll the dice and tri my luck . 18 minut later , i final got my chili and fri . go if there is no line , but if there is one , someth 's up and it wo n't be pretti .
thi wa my first cirqu show and i wa total in <unk> . i had big <unk> on my face all night . the stunt were amaz and realli had a wow factor . the stage were awesom . there wa a stunt where the perform were n't wear ani kind of <unk> ! ! ! realli <unk> stuff . i like how ka had stori to it . i total felt that it wa worth the money . i saw o the follow night and i wa complet disappoint with o. o to me wa more <unk> artist freak show . ka wa head and shoulder abov o in term of music , visual , and <unk> . the audienc at ka gave the perform a stand <unk> unlik the o perform i went to .
their donut are awesom , i love the `` fat elvi '' especi , but have had quit a few of what they have there and everyth i 've had ha alway been good , the servic is alway fast and friendli , i highli recommend them : - )
thi place is horribl ! ! ! my father just pass away and thi <unk> disrespect hi wife and tell her we can go somewher els ! ! ! then she start catch attitud with me and yell at me ! ! thi is ridicul for <unk> sake
great coffe spot . great art on the wall and <unk> place . the area is cool to walk around dure the day . almost hipster vibe ? amaz book store across the road . i tri to stay clear after dark but mayb that 's just me .
my husband and i are obsess with golden gate ! we have live in the <unk> area forev and had never tri it until thi last novemb . the atmospher is your typic chines restaur complet with authent decor and a giant fish <unk> . we love the hot tea and the meal that are meant to split . everyth we tri wa tasti and had us veri satisfi ! the owner is so sweet and friendli . on our second trip for dinner , she came over and introduc herself to us . she share her stori with us and just gave us more reason to want to come back again and again .
the wagyu <unk> wa realli tasti , but for $ <unk> , not the best steak i 've ever had . total expect more for my money . the yelp review were right . it is good , but overpr for what you get . the garlic mash potato were butteri and whip . melt in your mouth , but you 'd expect that for $ 12 . a good size portion in line with other steak hous . i enjoy the live music . <unk> tune that enhanc the experi .
servic is bad & slow . it took 10 minut after sit to get our drink order taken ( onli 5 tabl with patron ) . in fact , while we were wait for breakfast one patron simpli walk out after have order . i sat near the open kitchen area , i observ the staff . i saw the waitress move toast on the plate with her bare hand - wash much ? the hash brown were good & my wife enjoy her omelett . big problem with the crepe . the crepe came from the kitchen burn on the edg . to hi credit the cook notic me flake off the burnt edg and offer to make us anoth crepe to go . i would have given 2 star becaus it ha great potenti but i had to take 1 back becaus of the servic .
we went here tonight for some <unk> and could n't be happier with the restaur . servic wa great , food wa just like what we had in cajun countri . highli recommend thi place !
kinda crappi but i would stay again on a budget . their is a weird place in my hard for circu circu , it bad but not <unk> . first , the peopl that do the check in are the most miser human in the planet . did some one tell them to go as slow as possibl ? serious , it should take you no longer then 2-3 minut to check me in . the place is <unk> with smoke , i mean <unk> i do n't care that much but some peopl do . their is a stale tast in the air . the place as a whole is kinda cool , the look of it , the indoor activ like <unk> wall and extrem ride like you would find on the <unk> . the room , poor without be dirti . they are bore ye . do i feel like i 'm in the 70 's ye . but they are clean so i cant complain too much . the steak hous insid is good but expens . avoid the buffet for sure ( much better option in vega for same price ) if you are go there becaus you have too and your on a budget do n't <unk> . but their are much better option if your go to do vega do it right !
great happi hour ! food is good my favorit thing on the menu are the jamaican jerk chicken wing . they have so much flavor ! the drink are great and the server are alway friendli !
love it last night . my new person favorit cocktail is the <unk> . the bartend had some seriou <unk> . the atmospher wa chill and cozi . you can find type of person at thi place as well . if you have never been to a speak easi you need to tri it . i highli suggest it on date night or if you are out with the boy . shout out to the manag <unk> . she brought an amaz energi to the place and made our stay veri fun . enjoy !
great atmospher & phenomen servic . our waitress wa top notch ! she wa friendli , funni and never let our glass go empti . she knew the menu front to back and wa readi to help if we had ani question . the bread basket is full of differ option so there 's someth for everyon . they special in all thing seafood ( henc the name lol ) but nonetheless everyth wa delici . their side are serv famili style . be care on how much you order becaus you will be full by the end . if you are n't a seafood fan , do n't <unk> - they have steak as well !
i do not get the good review of thi place . sub are bland bland bland . it wa like eat a paper plate . wo n't return .
omg the food wa terribl . no tast , it wa super bland . on top of that it took forev to order even though they were n't that pack . we kept have to track down our server and have breakfast here took way longer than it should have . i would not recommend thi place for breakfast .
i 'm a wrap kinda gal . i think most <unk> delight are packag quit well in a <unk> tomato basil tortilla to creat a <unk> and hand held meal , and for thi reason i just love that 's a wrap . they 've move past the standard <unk> the caesar salad in a mission tortilla ' <unk> and graduat to , one of my favorit creation , my sherri <unk> : grill chicken , spinach , saute button <unk> , grill onion , feta chees , all in a super <unk> case of homemad tortilla and it 's warm to boot ! if you 're feel <unk> carb consciou , do n't let thi tortilla heaven scare you off becaus they will put ani wrap creation 's content <unk> a bed of <unk> or spinach . big thumb up for : fresh <unk> and lemonad , smile staff , and yummi pasta salad . the onli , not so irrit i might add , issu are : limit park and <unk> long line ( note : thi onli appli dure lunch rush )
great experi overal . the menu is veri thought of and structur . can realli show how much the chef wa creativ when they came up with the menu . i had the shrimp to start . they were on point , realli tender with a littl kick from the jalapeño but not that spici . for the main i had the scallop . all i can say is that i would come back again for the scallop ani day , ani time . fantast restaur and experi .
first introduc to <unk> when it wa on <unk> road . now the restaur is locat just east of cleveland 's `` <unk> mile '' at <unk> squar . it is expens for the valu of the meal . <unk> <unk> is not veal as is the tradit recip , but the cheaper pork version . still ha a nice flavour , but again for the price . i enjoy my onc in everi three year visit to the <unk> , but be prepar to shell out $ $ and also , food qualiti is n't up to <unk> .
my mother wa sent here for over a month while recov from surgeri . mani of the nurs were rude to her dure her stay , she struggl to get her pain med regularli go <unk> without ani pain medic onli a few day after surgeri . when it came time for her to leav , the doctor wrote her a script for pain med which she could not fill becaus the center fill <unk> worth of her pain med a week prior to be releas so the insur would not cover and the pharmaci show those med as be fill . when we contact the care center they told her that they destroy ani remain medic and can not releas them to the patient . i have spent 5 day now tri to go between the care center , her regular doctor , and the insur to resolv the issu . in the mean time my mother ha had to suffer in pain becaus the care center would not contact the pharmaci or the insur to provid them with <unk> record . it is neglig to send patient home with the <unk> to fill medic when they leav especi when most individu are still recov from major surgeri . i would never recommend thi place to anyon .
hot new spot in itali petit . nice decor , and great servic . most of the dish are small , and not a lot of option on the menu . the dish were a mix . i enjoy the <unk> .
great place . me and my ladi tri it . food wa delici . servic wa veri good . the woman wa veri thought and took care of us . forgot to leav a tip though . felt bad about it . look forward to return even though it far from my hous .
i 've given thi place 3 chanc and wa disappoint everi time ! thi is not good sushi ! a classic california roll doe n't even have all 3 proper ingredi ! thi sushi is sub-par and they should 've paid me to eat it ! the sushi wa sloppi , poorli present , fall apart , cut <unk> ! i wo n't be back ! 3 <unk> and you 're out ! ! ! !
thi place offer both <unk> and take out option . it 's clean and the servic is quick . it might be a littl too quick ... while read the menu , i wa ask 3 time in the span of about 2 minut if i need help or wa readi to order . they definit tri to <unk> me with offer of spring roll ( which i accept ) and then more <unk> with offer drink . we got two take out dish -- the spici noodl bowl and the pad thai . the food wa super hot , in term of temperatur and took a long time to cool down . the spici noodl bowl wa ok , but the pad thai wa uninspir . it fill a hole in the belli , but that 's about it . i agre that thi place is over price . still <unk> about whether i 'll ever go back .
my boyfriend and i been here 3 time and it wa delici each time . servic is fast and veri friendli . will definit keep come for weekend breakfast !
oh my god ! one of the last <unk> left in thi dessert a well preserv part of histori highli recommend a most place to see if you go to fremont , price are access and food is outstand their latt are awesom as well . join them for breakfast or dinner you wo n't de disappoint
i have n't been abl to find a steak salad i like better than the one here , which is a pain becaus thi place is so far from me . but it 's <unk> and the home made blue chees dress ca n't be beat . the servic is fast , and dan the manag is genuin friendli in a non fake way . oh ... . and i love how now i can order a half salad so that i can also get like an appet too .
we stay at the <unk> and got in late . but after a full day of work , pack , and flight we were hungri . we check in around 9:30 and were told the restaur close at 10 - but they 'd allow us to be seat at 10 so we rush to our room , threw on a quick dress and head back down stair . we had a group of 6 and they were pleasant enough consid we arriv at pretti much 10 on the <unk> . the restaur is stun . the seat is laid out veri nice and there are great booth and more privat booth area to choos from . all the detail are beauti . the food is good too . nice wine list and cocktail to choos from . there 's a prix fix menu to choos from which make it all pretti reason . we had some <unk> assort of item from the menu and everyon wa happi with their select . the servic wa just ok , but perhap we just caught them off guard arriv so late and want food , wine and cocktail . if we ever stay again we 'll definit be back again .
i went here for a work dinner with cowork . we pick thi place becaus we knew it would be great for share plate . they have an extens wine list , as expect , which can be a bit overwhelm . howev , they have the menu on an <unk> on the tabl so you can more easili break it down . i had a red blend that i realli enjoy . as for the plate that we share , there were 5 of us and we order 8 small plate . it wa definit more than enough ! we order : <unk> belli blt <unk> taco <unk> <unk> poke <unk> sprout <unk> salad <unk> <unk> chees <unk> + the complimentari bread and <unk> butter out of the abov item , i would eat the pork taco , calamari and brussel sprout again in a heart beat . i like the poke as well , but would n't necessarili order it again . the pork blt wa delici ( cut like butter ! ) , but hard to eat and hard to share . i need anoth excus to go back here to tri more dish and the creme <unk> , which appar ha a layer of browni in it . sound amaz ! share plate and split the bill wa a good way to go . get your money worth !
i 'm a fan of japanes curri . <unk> curri is alright for the valu , but it certainli is n't my favorit in town . i had eaten at the old locat a while ago and honestli rememb like it a littl more . the curri sauc itself ha an enjoy flavor to it and they offer a nice varieti of option -- sever of which will do in a pinch , but none that <unk> me to come back to them . fan of udon noodl can get curri udon ... that 's someth you do n't find everywher , but not a big enough draw for me . like the 3 star say , they 're `` <unk> '' there are better option in walk distanc though which make me think i will not be come back anytim soon . <unk> curri is open late -- <unk> late ... so if you are in the mood for japanes curri and it is after 11pm when all the other shop have close down it would <unk> you stop in for a <unk> bite . the staff is nice , but the small kitchen can get back up in a hurri . expect a wait if there are even a few order ahead of you ... or if you are a part of a larg parti . come here for late night japanes curri ... come here late while the dj is play for an <unk> dine experi ... come here if you 're a <unk> on a budget ... expect to wait if you come here and find other patron ...
okay , first time here - the staff wa friendli and explain thing well . ... the choic can be overwhelm . i went with 2 long beach to start out . someon told me the portion size were a littl small - they were wrong and i 'm go to end up with way too much food ! the food is fresh and tasti ! will definit need to repeat to tri more on the menu !
unfortun , i did n't read the review on thi place befor i came . if i did , i would have went elsewher . thi place is a total 2 star . i 'll give it prop for be <unk> lit and decent clean . i order the coconut waffl , some frozen yogurt , an ice mocha coffe and littl cream puff that they make there . the coconut waffl wa green ... <unk> . it did n't have much flavor at all . my ice coffe wa horribl . i bare took 2 sip . the red velvet frozen yogurt tast gross . it had a realli weird flavor . i ca n't quit put my finger on it but it did n't tast like the red velvet yogurt i get a golden spoon . the cream puff were ok . they definit need more cream . one thing that realli stood out , and not in a good way , wa the loud speak system that announc when your order is readi . i 've made a rule . dont eat at anyth less than 4 star . i , again , broke my own rule . i tri to be <unk> though . i tri to `` live in the old day '' were yelp doesnt rule my life . and , that fail me everytim . there are so mani good place to eat in chinatown . unfortun , thi is n't one of them .

neither the bartend or the waiter knew what a whiskey sour wa . i do n't mean they did n't know how to make it ( though they did n't ) , i 'm say they argu with me , they did not believ it wa a cocktail . ... which is a challeng when you charg <unk> buck for a <unk> .

serious , i can not stress how awesom thi shop is . i did n't choos to go here becaus of how few review they had and i end up get screw by one of the most popular scooter shop around . i went here and they treat me like famili . after i left , i had a small issu and they pick it up and drop it off at my work . they know scooter . they also have the most ador shop dog ! if you are have doubt about where to take your scooter , these guy are honest , hard work guy just tri to make your scooter reliabl . did i mention they 're honest ? you wo n't find a better shop in town .
i had not been to the <unk> garden befor and enjoy simpli walk around and look at the <unk> , ( there wa no place to sit as it wa pack ) . howev my friend rememb the <unk> be narrow and there be more flower ... i would have gone more often if park wa n't an issu ... but i would n't spend more than hour there as there is n't that much to do or look at .

bad busi ! while visit famili dure the holiday , i had screen on phone chang out and purchas new screen protector . return to <unk> the next day and notic my phone wa act strang , <unk> , open up app , type <unk> into msg line , place call . i contact the manag and he want me to remov the screen protector , which will not be <unk> afterward . then he want me to mail my phone to him , he would replac screen , and mail back to me but not refund me my mail expens . i went to a local repair shop and wa inform the screen wa <unk> . i contact the manag at <unk> <unk> and ask them to pay for the new screen . he want me to mail the screen back to him . i explain that i would onc he paid for the new screen and he would not entertain anyth until i mail the screen back to him . avoid thi place at all cost ! ! !
thi place is a hidden gem ! i wa look for <unk> place in <unk> , and came across <unk> , special in middl eastern food . the decor is simpl and clean - dark wood tabl , <unk> against the wall , and photo and <unk> on the wall . mani dish come with the salad bar - which is awesom ! thi is not your typic salad bar - there wa <unk> , <unk> ( refresh but a littl salti ) , cucumb salad , possibl the best <unk> i 've ever had , pickl turnip , oliv , <unk> slaw , and more . everyth wa great . we were brought pipe hot fresh pita ( <unk> ! ) and delici and smooth <unk> . our waitress wa pleasant and funni , and recommend the <unk> chicken ( $ 11 ) , which she said wa delici . it wa ! <unk> sweet and incred juici . at our tabl wa also the <unk> <unk> plate ( $ <unk> ) , <unk> plate ( $ 11 ) , and filet mignon <unk> plate ( $ 13 ) . everyth wa veri good - the <unk> wa <unk> and pack with crispi piec of onion and fresh <unk> , and the filet wa nice cook , though there wa a littl <unk> . there wa a bit of confus with the order in term of order half <unk> and onli receiv potato , but the rice wa good so i did n't mind . the <unk> ratio is pretti hard to beat - i wish i knew about hi place earlier !
the best place for pan roast ever , hand down the choic for anyon or everyon
amaz food ! just tri it tonight on our way home from ski . i had a chicago dog which wa <unk> authent ! <unk> green relish and sport pepper ! the fri are amaz and they have malt vinegar on the tabl which pair beauti ! the cole slaw wa veri good and i saw but did n't tri the chicken quesadilla which wa liter grill ! will definit frequent see as it 's on the way back from mani place we visit outsid the s hill !
thi place is no longer in the pittsburgh public market . i understand they now oper a food truck .
almost a 5 . great decor and ambianc pair with a great select of brunch item and innov twist on breakfast stapl . the pancak may even make it on the <unk> home . fluffi stack of hot cake with a decad berri <unk> and whip cream . the grill chees is heaven and if you pair them with the rosemari potato you have a win combo . server are super accommod and friendli . been back a few time now and not just becaus it 's close to our home ... . highli recommend !
i love frozen yogurt ! such a sweet treat ! what i do n't like it water down yogurt ! <unk> <unk> ( <unk> on mill ave ) thi place is realli good and the yogurt is n't water down . i use to live out thi way so i would come here often especi sinc it wa open til midnight on weekend ! i love the varieti of top they have , cheesecak ! ! ! ! ! ! that is a top i usual do n't see at yogurt shop . it can be a bit of a wait dure certain time , but that did n't bother me . : )
five guy stick to the basic . but <unk> it tast so good . the atmospher of thi place is veri welcom . the staff wa veri friendli and answer all of my first timer question . ok now to the food . i order a chees burger not know that the regular come with 2 patti and the cajun fri . let 's start with the best fresh cut fri that i have ever tast at a fast food establish . they were freshli cut , season to perfect , and about the size of human finger . they serv them in a cup but do n't stop there , then they throw the cup in a brown paper bag and toss anoth <unk> of fri on top of that . amaz . well worth the 3 dollar , and one order will definit feed 2 full size adult . i order the hamburg with just about everyth on it becaus i want to experi the gooey , <unk> , of other burger that cost about the same . i almost had troubl finish the meal becaus it wa that over the top . all of the top were free so they do n't tri to <unk> and <unk> you . i paid 19 buck for 2 burger , one order of regular fri and 2 drink . give it a shot you want be disappoint .
i wa on a busi trip and just happen to book a hotel near the airport - not know that the neighborhood wa a punjabi belt . i wa in mississauga for around 4 day and i must say that for the first time in my 20 year of be outsid of <unk> , i actual had indian food - in all my meal . i end up <unk> my visit between punjabi <unk> and standard sweet . about standard sweet - it is right next to the airport and is <unk> a sweet shop , sell indian sweet and salti snack . they have a kitchen in the back and a restaur area in half of the shop . they serv indian buffet for lunch and also have `` a la cart '' menu through out the day . the place is just ok when it come to <unk> . the food is delici and is true punjabi style . their <unk> are great and veri fill . the rate are veri <unk> and they also have a free wi-fi in hous . there are 2 issu i have with their food and set up : 1 ) the food is veri oili and greasi . i remind them everi time to not make my food greasi - and sure enough - that never happen . it wa alway drip with <unk> etc . 2 ) the kitchen is run my some old indian <unk> - and to that <unk> , the <unk> part is sort of <unk> . use of hand , without glove , open <unk> etc is common . in fact , one earli morn , i end up be at the shop right when it just open and saw one of the old <unk> eat in a bowl , wash it in the restroom and keep it back in the stack to be use for buffet . obvious , i never went back to them ever again . punjabi <unk> , right next door turn out great for me and i spend rest of my dollar and day there . am give them 3 star becaus of the 2 issu i mention abov .
thi is realli good chines , best in the east side <unk> . we share <unk> beef and pork dumpl . both were enorm portion for the money , but the <unk> beef could have been a littl more spici . our waitress wa help in pick out how much food to get . we will definit be back to tri some of the more adventur dish or the hot pot on a veri cold night . for a first time we did n't go full forc . also , better to go to a place like thi with a group of 6 or more so that you can share sever thing .
ate a saturday night dinner here . the staff is veri profession , almost formal in some case but not in a stuffi <unk> way . posit mark for them . the restaur which is around queen and <unk> , is in a bit of an <unk> shape space with a love entri , follow by a narrow section then open into larg invit almost commun room with high ceil , one expos brick wall and a white <unk> expos kitchen in the back . the food wa veri good . i had sear scallop for an app and chicken for a main . the chicken wa veri good and done almost like a <unk> bleu in the shape of a log . i rare would order chicken at a restaur but thi wa worth it . the dish were both prepar with tasti well thought out side . along with a fun cocktail list thi place is worth the ride to the more and more trendi queen east .
whi doe thi place have to suck so bad ! ? ! ? i show up 30 min befor they close and the girl with the purpl hair say she ca n't make me coffe unless it 's cold becaus she took her dish back to <unk> whi would n't you do that when you close ? i guess they need to do a last call for coffe as well as beer .
great somewhat hidden place for breakfast . noth fanci , but great fairli price food . ate here 3 time dure my arizona vacat . will definit be back next year .
i wa genuin disappoint by thi place . after my 3rd visit , i have n't been back and am current switch to a new <unk> . dr. <unk> ha too mani patient and ha a lack of <unk> for a first time mother such as myself . when i first came in , i told him i thought i wa pregnant . he pretti much took my word for it , and never even gave me a <unk> test himself ! just sent me off to the lab . they do n't follow up with lab result . i call dr. <unk> and ask him about it after almost two week . he ask `` did anyon call you ? '' . i said `` no , but i would like <unk> that everyth is okay '' . he respond `` well that probabl mean it okay . how <unk> you call me on monday afternoon , and i 'll see what i can do '' . the last straw wa when he gave me a <unk> . ( i 'm go to tri and use as few detail as possibl ) . i 'm 25 year old , so i 've had my share of them . after not prep the tool properli , he gave me the most pain <unk> i 've ever had in my life . while i wa <unk> on the tabl , he continu <unk> me until he realiz he would have to stop and give me a moment becaus it wa too pain . final it wa done , and after he wa finish he stood right up and ask me if i had ani question , while my leg were still in the <unk> . did n't give me a chanc to get myself togeth or relax . i said no . he read me my previou lab result and walk right out . i will never recommend thi place .
thi target ha a larger varieti of product , compar to <unk> that is . the staff wa friendli
food is still good , but they do need to hire more peopl on the floor ! and also the kitchen can keep you wait and wait when it get busi , mani time like that i would have to finish the whole meal by take one dish at a time . imagin the bowl of rice turn ice cold when the last dish arriv .
experi wa good and the guy take order in the food truck wa realli nice . the wing were crispi which is great . although i ask for hot when i order the buffalo bill wing and they tast veri mild . that could just be a matter of opinion though . they dont serv bleu chees ! ! what 's a wing place without bleu chees ? !
everyon is incred rude and act like they are do u a favor allow u to book at their hotel . in thi <unk> they will never <unk> . what a bunch of asshol .
alway order deliveri from here . onlin order veri easi . their pizza is delici and they use delici chees . both hand toss and thin crust are phenomen . deliveri is not alway on time but alway worth the wait . <unk> with chees crazi good as well . white pizza is great . i prefer thin crust becaus less fill . older man that work there , act like a manag , is a jerk to other that work there so that 's whi 1 less star .
oh man . i am so glad i found thi place on yelp . the food wa fantast and what better than the food ? the price and servic . had a great time and would definit go back veri soon
we din <unk> atmospher : restaur is tuck away on a street . we almost pass it ! when you walk in , it 's extrem dark and realli loud . but we were site next to a tabl of 10 . our waitress wa kind , but wa far and between when check on us . food : a great rang of tapa food . from vegetarian , sea and meat . it 's hard to pin point what stood out becaus we order at least 15 differ plate . but person the prosciutto <unk> stick out . absolut fantast . it wa a bold punch of flavor . that just melt in your mouth . i would go back just to eat thi . we stuck with a bottl of wine and skip desert . overal : would i return ? mayb at lunch if it wa better lit ? and wa abl to have a convers with my colleagu . also for the <unk> . wa n't blown away .
gave thi compani a tri after the great review on yelp . <unk> wa my technician and he did a <unk> check on my central air . i got central air educ . i understand so much more about my central air unit after speak to <unk> . i replac my condens . i wa glad i did becaus have the condens do a <unk> job effect the compressor later . i do not want to replac the compressor anytim soon . i bought the mainten packag from thi compani and i am look forward to have my furnac servic in the fall . thi is a top notch compani .
i love thi place so much and i 'm not sure if the girl that work there are start to get freak out about it or not . i 've had so mani drink on the menu and they 're all good ! my favorit so far is the summer drink ( alo , <unk> , lemon , mint ) becaus it 's so refresh and i love the textur of the alo and <unk> . my boyfriend wo n't order anyth but the mango yogurt . i urg you to ask them about their new drink or ani <unk> stuff they have , becaus i 've never gone wrong ask them to make whatev is their favorit or new . the menu is huge and the atmospher is cute and quiet and they have a ton of board game . i and my friend will sometim even get a drink for there and a drink to take home , becaus they 're that good .
ok jimmi , here it is . my nail are off the chain . my manag said they are veri <unk> 's secret . he is a true nail tech . <unk> is pretti awesom as well . i look forward to get my nail done there . never disappoint .
absolut the worst meal i 've ever had . burger and sweet potato fri . both were terribl . if i 'm ever at the toronto airport again remind myself to not eat here no matter what . go to subway instead or full up on muffin at starbuck .
right now i 'm veri dissatisfi with thi place ! i place a takeout order for gener <unk> 's , beef lo mein & crab rangoon . i order thi at about <unk> , right befor go in to wait . while wait i notic the place wa practic empti and rememb the order said it 'd take <unk> <unk> minut . so i figur about 15 minut at most . but no , it seem they screw up and forgot about my order sinc a girl work there came up to me to ask my name and what i wa wait on . i did n't get my order until <unk> . an hour ? ! ? serious ? ? ? thi is horribl ! now i 'm wait to see what my time and money got me onc i 'm home . then i 'll updat thi base on the food qualiti .
i <unk> love hot dog so when i found out that thi place wa open down the street i wa delight , and went open day . i order the basic nake dog sinc i find it 's just to judg a place on how the they cook someth simpl . so what doe a $ 6.50 hot dog tast like ? not much differ than one for $ 3 that you can get on a street corner . the sausag wa averag , noth special . the bun wa a <unk> and would n't surpris me if they get it from the same place your corner hot dog vendor doe ... it wa also burnt a littl . i understand that dure a rush thi is someth that might happen to a piec of bread left over fire but the place wa empti . common guy . the top were creativ but <unk> , rhubarb thi , blueberri mayo that , <unk> of crab flavour sauc . whi would i want to put `` fresh '' soak wet mozzarella on my hotdog ? the relish wa good . they didnt appear to have yellow mustard , which i am assum is n't <unk> enough , but they had ketchup . while i wa eat , 2 of the worker were discuss what appear to be a sausag at the end of a long fork that one of them wa hold . after some <unk> he threw it into the garbag . that 's 6 buck <unk> , i could have taken the bu twice with that sausag . that sausag <unk> help me pay my phone bill last month . i want to tri the mapl lemonad i read about but it wa $ 5 . that 's five dollar for lemon and water peopl . save your time go to <unk> for a larger , cheaper , more interest hot <unk> select .
in a word , disappoint . i 've never dine at delux . despit their reput , i find it hard to believ that i could get a burger , better then an anim style , <unk> , outsid my own grill . now that i know that the folk who own delux also own <unk> , i doubt that i will ever tast a delux burger . my friend and i order separ . i , a green chili burrito and she , a chees crisp . servic wa ok . i got my burrito in a time fashion but my friend had to wait forev for her chees crisp . thi is n't a sit down joint so i do n't <unk> it too much for that . i pick up my burrito and as it wa <unk> over , i took my first bite . it <unk> . i saw what littl wa insid , sink to the bottom half of the tortilla . my burrito wa <unk> . what fill wa insid wa bland and of littl <unk> . the salsa wa pretti good but need it is not a plu . my friend chees crisp wa good but no point for melt chees on an open tortilla and <unk> guacamol and <unk> de <unk> on it . i certainli wo n't be eat here again . i am not fool by upscal decor . on a side note : the <unk> place are just as fresh as a <unk> . say they 're not make you look ignor and <unk> .
veri nice ambienc . it quit small but the crepe are delici and reason price ( compar to other ) they do n't use nutella or ani sugar ( except for the organ kind ) . <unk> , the staff speak french and the music is french too . it realli feel like you just step into a <unk> cafe . love it , and i 've tri mani <unk> .
i came here think it would be great as review through yelp , but realiz that the servic wa realli bad . we did not get the full amount of side dish until i decid to speak korean to the waiter . they first gave us 3 then after speak korean we receiv 3 more side dish . the food wa mediocr consid the price rang .
omg best <unk> restaur i 've ever been to and it 's not expens at all ! 3 plate , a side of fish , a side of stew beef , and 3 drink for $ <unk> . i 'm in heaven you guy ! you should definit eat here ! !
i like thi place for all of it outsid real <unk> , i do n't like the cup they put your <unk> in .

great cheap eat in comparison to other restaur ! the burger cost $ 6.00 and the ribey $ <unk> . for some reason there is no mention in other review of the `` honest to good fee '' of 3 % .. i ask the server and thi is to keep the price low . not bad . that 's onli $ <unk> per $ 100.00 spent . thi wa the old all star wing and the place is great with tabl , booth , lot of space , big dine area and big screen tv . i ask the server if they play pay per view like ufc or box . they said ye . they had the m <unk> vs <unk> fight . ye , thi is a great secret i could have kept to ensur it doe n't get too busi here , but am share with you all . consid the price of the food and the fact they have a beauti venu and live event , thi place is a fantast place ! server were friendli . not onli that beer is cheap ! ! $ 4 pint when the leaf play and $ 5 <unk> pint , it sure if thi is onli for tuesday . now , they also have chicken wing for half price after 9 pm . i can imagin thi place get pack ! ! ! will definit come back ! ! ! !
do n't wast your time . went in , and after spend 10 minut wait to be help , final spoke with an employe who could bare be bother to write down the exact <unk> and model i wa look for a quot on . told me he wa too busi to help me further at the time , but he promis to follow up in the <unk> day . of cours , noth . i call back a week later to tri and follow up , and left all the same info as befor , but never heard again . <unk> busi model . appar they lack interest in both custom and make money . i went elsewher .
the bar situat here is pretti terribl . the good - the decor is awesom . decent price to bowl . awesom locat . the bad - the bartend just make it nearli imposs to drink here . i guess they do n't want to make much money for the lane or for themselv ... i 've been here befor where i just want to stop by to see some friend who were bowl , and i could n't get serv becaus i wa n't bowl . which is just unreal . there were mayb 3 or 4 peopl insid the bar too and still could n't get a drink . recent , i wa here with a group of peopl ... i almost did n't get serv again becaus i could n't prove i wa bowl , although i wa wait for my parti to arriv ! i also understand need to card someon , but as a 36 year old guy , if a friend want to go to the bar and grab a beer for himself and me , i should n't have to walk all the way back to the bar everi singl time . it 's just so inconveni ...
happi <unk> , had to swing by for lunch as wa crave someth savori and sweet . <unk> is the best homemad local bakeri offer delic croissant and savori sandwich croissant and pot pie to make you forget ani of those chain store bakeri . come on down to south temp to find them on weekday onli as they pop up around town at variou farmer market on weekend .
realli good valu ; you wo n't spend much to get a flavor , veri fill meal here . as with most <unk> restaur , the menu item are serv on a gener <unk> of soft <unk> bread , with more <unk> bread serv on the side . while i wa tempt to get the veggi combo with it 7 item and salad , i 'm glad i opt to get the <unk> veggi combo becaus even that turn out to be a lot of food . i chose <unk> <unk> ( red split <unk> ) , <unk> ( spice string bean with carrot and onion ) , <unk> <unk> ( cabbag with potato ) , and mushroom <unk> . the combo wa a good balanc of mild and <unk> flavor , and refresh ice <unk> shai ( a <unk> tea of <unk> , cinnamon , and <unk> ) wa a perfect match for the flavor <unk> . thi restaur is a gem of a find in the arcadia area .
although their food is extrem overpr , we enjoy go here everi other year as a treat to ourselv . the sunday brunch is yummi . i greatli enjoy their egg benedict and my son can almost finish the gigant breakfast burrito . the cheesecak is , of cours , fantast ! we have tri sever flavor and have yet to be disappoint by ani of them . we would go more often and i would have given 5 star , if they were n't so overpr .
my daughter and i were look for a new breakfast adventur and we stumbl on villag garden . great , fast servic for breakfast , good tradit fare with nice portion . we went with the `` car in the park lot '' <unk> to help guid us and it didnt fail - great place . not much more to share other than we 'll be back .

in my most recent visit , i order the <unk> <unk> , which i would recommend to anyon tri to avoid the tast of averag , fri bar food . thi wa much better than past sandwich i 've order . i do miss the artichok or asparagu flatbread . huge portion . had a pretti good bloodi mari but wa n't serv the more <unk> one advertis ... oh well probabl save some money and it still came with a <unk> of ani qualiti ( ye ! ) . sat at the bar to avoid a wait dure a busi sunday . it wa pleasant , plenti spaciou with quick attent by the bartend .
i 'm go to give thi place 5 star onli becaus i feel bad i kinda threw up on their floor ... i 'm realli sorri , jimmi . i wa realli trash ! !
the minut you walk in the shop wa clean and the person in the front wa veri friendli . i got my <unk> pierc by <unk> and i will have to say it been my best experi with get pierc hand down . he wa profession , made you feel veri comfort and walk you thru the process . i would definit recommend him and will be go back if i decid on ani futur pierc .
i use to come here all the time with my famili year ago , but the crowd and experi ha definit chang <unk> sinc i wa last here . the servic wa fairli decent , but the food wa extrem over salt . the peopl dine here were extrem loud , and thi wa n't limit to a singl group of peopl . there use to be a cozi and warm vibe here , but that 's been complet void by the obnoxi behavior of the patron . i suppos it 's not red lobster 's fault , it 's just a shame to see the place chang like that . one thing ha remain the same though ... the cheddar bay biscuit are just as delici as i rememb them !
the ayc is amaz ! it includ appet , sushi and <unk> . they have a huge varieti of roll and they are delici !
<unk> where to start with the <unk> center . my friend and i all have season pass so there 's veri littl we have n't done . it 's great for famili , group of friend , team build event , etc . i 'm just gon na start from the begin . you walk up to the front and you 're greet by one of the friendliest guy i 've ever met . he 's alway ask how you 're do , what you 're plan , alway follow by the most sincer `` i hope you guy realli enjoy your time here today '' ( or someth along those line ) . everybodi who work there ha the same <unk> alway look for way to make your day better . we usual start off with the zip line . it 's just a good way to wake up . plu you feel kinda like you 're fli . my favorit part is the raft , of cours . raft guid can accommod all group , from famili with young children to wild , crazi 20 and <unk> . you just tell them what kind of ride you want and they 'll give it to you . if you want a safe ride , they can do that . if you want to be guarante to fall out , they can do that too . request `` raft <unk> '' for a great time ! well , as long as you do n't have kid with you . you 're pretti much guarante a rough ride and someon will probabl fall out but it is soooo much fun you cant help but laugh when it 's over . all of the rope cours are fun and a good challeng . the <unk> <unk> and <unk> are both great way to explor the <unk> river . if you want to , you can park you <unk> or <unk> and just lay out on one of the beach , or just float along the river . it 's veri relax ! and the best part ? the end of the day . there 's a great select of beer ( includ beer from local breweri ) at the river edg bar and grill and after a long day of play in the water and burn ton of calori , a cool refresh beer is perfect . ca n't wait for next season and all the new thing to come !
time manag seem to be a problem for one specif waitress . both time i 've gone i 've had the same one , and she complet forget to bring out item you order and then claim to have put them <unk> as if that 's some sort of excus for you not get what you order . order egg benedict today and the egg were cold and still a littl runni . also order a latt that did n't come until after my food came . the food itself is n't bad , but i 'd like to be abl to receiv my order in a more time fashion .
if i could give 0 star to thi hotel , i would . the first issu we had is that the toilet stop flush on it own . we look into it to see what the issu wa , and it turn out the flush mechan wa held togeth by a <unk> safeti pin . we call the front desk to have it fix , but it took 2 hour . the biggest issu we had is that our card wa charg <unk> . we paid for a packag deal for a hotel room and ticket to an event , in addit to a singl day sinc we arriv a day earli . the front desk assur me that the deposit would just cover the one day sinc the rest of the weekend wa cover by the packag deal . a week later , my card wa charg for the full weekend instead of the one day . i call in the morn to get the charg revers , but the front desk said they need a manag to revers the charg . i call the manag <unk> herself and left a messag , and i have not heard at all from her . i final call the front desk again and someon name <unk> said she would revers the charg , howev i still not have receiv the revers and they did not offer a receipt . thi charg should not have been made in the first place , and they see <unk> about refund me in a time fashion . i will not be stay here again in the futur and would not recommend it to anyon els .
i have to admit that the atmospher realli take from the experi , it 's seem to have been convert from a ga station or some small burger joint . howev , the chicken wa good and the donut `` ok '' no major complaint , noth that realli stood out to make me want to visit again ... it 's ok ... just ok .
oh my my ! gordon ramsay live up to hi name ... we bare got reserv cuz thi place is jam pack alway . if you 're in the mood to splurg and eat some top notch good food - thi is the place to be at ! our server seem pretti knowledg and seem to have everyth memor thoroughli . she came with sampl of meat which wa pretti neat i think to see the cut and qualiti of what you 're about to order . ( post a video ) soon as we sat down , they serv us a platter full of wide select of bread with the butter with black <unk> sea salt . it wa so delici . we ask for the most popular dish there and she suggest the rib cap - which ha been my favourit steak i 've ever eaten so far ! just melt in your mouth and the glaze is absolut delici . my husband order beef wellington ( ramsay signatur dish ) which i 've tri as well and i like my rib cap better . wellington had ton of flavour and in layer . it wa like a parti in your mouth . although one item that stick to my <unk> still and i ca n't get over it ha to be the truffl mac n chees made with blue chees . god bless them for come up with that dish ! make sure to order that . we 've also order load bake potato which wa veri well season and delici as well . howev , a plain glass of water will cost you us $ 10 . but like i said , one of those night you just want to splurg ! thi ha been an awesom memori for both me and my husband and i would definit go back here .
north ha great cocktail , great food , and pretti good servic . i feel like we tri all of the appet and the fri zucchini wa probabl the onli thing i did n't like . it 's such a simpl thing , but the bread and butter that came with the pasta wa realli good . scallop and fish have been excel here , but i 'm not a huge fan of some of the pasta . the squid <unk> pasta is in a spici red tomato sauc which is too much for me . other than that , north is a great choic , whether you 're here for drink and appet or for a full dinner . i just wish they serv food later at night too .
thi studio wa my first hot yoga experi almost 2 year ago , and after a brief <unk> and mani other hot yoga studio travel , i 'm happi that i 've return . actual yoga - the <unk> brand ha never fail me , and i 've been to a coupl of studio in southern <unk> and the gta . the <unk> flow routin is <unk> and the gener the same across most studio , which , for a beginn , is great to get use to the <unk> . the studio - the <unk> of the studio ha <unk> sinc i wa there 2 year ago . the ladi 's room smell like <unk> , but i suppos that is expect given that it 's a hot yoga studio . the teacher - i 've been to the regular class , <unk> and commun and have never been disappoint . out of all the studio hop i 've done , i 've truli enjoy the qualiti of the teacher at thi mississauga locat .

i 've live in phoenix for the past 18 month and been look for a place like thi my entir time i 've been here . remind me of florida where i live for 14 year and go back to next week for good . the <unk> the set-up of the restaur remind me of florida . most of all the food remind me of florida . i had 2 serv of the raw oyster , the <unk> combin with corn and bake bean and it wa soooo good ! the brisket liter melt in your mouth when you bite into it . i had the jalapeno ( level 2 ) sauc and it gave it that extra kick which realli set off the flavor of the meat . my gf had the salmon with rice and <unk> puppi . the salmon wa pretti close to perfect with white rice and came with coleslaw . all wa realli good . our server wa <unk> ( ? ) who wa veri knowledg and accommod and believ in the product she wa sell . for be on the job for a week she wa veri profession and knew her job . my onli regret wa that i did n't find thi place sooner as i would be here <unk> time a week .
thi place wa truli a hidden gem ! we came late one night and my parti order the philli , the green chili pork ( i honestli do n't rememb the name ) , and i had the meat and chees . in total , about $ 21 . mine wa delici , and like some other mention here ... no greas hangov ! i tri some of the philli and it wa amaz , and that jalapeno sauc wa truli great ! i could eat it alon ... . the pork <unk> , howev wa a littl bit too salti and wa the worst dish we order . that be said , it wa still delici . i would recommend thi place to anyon , and i definit recommend order the philli ! the onli thing that i should warn you about is that their <unk> is a littl <unk> than what i have had befor .

i did the ayc and they have a wide select of sushi roll to choos from . the good thing about thi place is you can order half roll so you do n't fill up too fast on just one . went on a friday night around 7 , wa n't too pack , they also have bar seat .
i love el pollo <unk> their food is amaz howev thi one is the wors . the cashier <unk> to each other rude the whole time and then when i order a side of mash potato and do n't get them it 's upset . when i order a 3 piec i want good piec not a wing that ha one strip onli of meat . anyway call to let the manag know and she want me to drive back to just for the mash potato i 'm not say i want extra but as a gener manag myself i alway throw someth els on to show custom appreci .

thi locat is over run with <unk> peopl tri to get a buck . i hate have to interact with peopl tri to get money from me everi time i go to pick up my coffe . the staff is gener onli speak spanish amongst themselv and they never acknowledg <unk> not a hello , good morn , or even a `` have a good day '' ever . i onli come here if i 'm run late to work and have zero option for a caffein fix . thi staff could def use some train in peopl skill . my drink are <unk> not good about 50 % of the time .
thi place is fantast . just great healthi food for a veri good price . most of the juic drink are great and the bison patti are awesom !
when you drive up you 're greet and given a ticket . not too mani smile , but due to the high heat ... .i guess i ca n't blame them . the ladi at the regist though ... .i super unpleas . no smile , greet or ani kind of posit custom servic . what doe she have to be upset about ? she ha a job , sit in a chair and ha a job ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! the worker actual work on car are hard worker . although i wish they were more detail in how they clean the <unk> and stuff . there were a lot of spot that were not clean like the <unk> or door . but overal they do a good job and have good price . i 'll go back .
i am visit wisconsin from california for a week . we have amaz mexican food where i am from and i am veri picki about it . i told myself i would n't get mexican or sushi while i wa out here . then someon said i had to give thi new place <unk> a chanc . everyth about thi place ( other than the build itself ) is fantast . the food wa veri veri good and authent . i got the <unk> <unk> with mole ' sauc . the waitstaff wa awesom and spoke spanish . our waiter nail our complic 5 person order without write a singl thing down . the margarita were larg , strong , and not made from <unk> sweet <unk> mix . i will make sure to come here everi time i visit <unk> . <unk> .

definit would recommend thi place ! we order the <unk> ( waffl with ice cream and chocol sauc ) and we were in a <unk> mood so we went with the chocol . everyth wa veri high qualiti , the waffl had a uniqu flavor and combin with the rich , creami ice cream , it definit hit the waffl spot . a bit pricey , but if you 're look for a treat , it 's well worth it ! the seat wa limit and the environ wa n't all that <unk> toward stay and eat as the place is rather small .
i love <unk> , the pizza is alway awesom they have the best honey bbq chicken wing everi ( they but <unk> to shame ) . servic is alway great here as well and the locat is great becaus it is in the nw valley with good park . they also deliv and i just found out yesterday that they have great lunch special with great price , you can get a slice of peperoni for $ <unk> , that is insan !

we brought our <unk> in here for it first oil chang and had an incred experi ! we realli went back and forth on whether or not we should take it in to the dealership for an oil chang but after chat with <unk> 's , read their incred yelp review , and learn of their love for toyota car , we felt comfort bring it here . i made an appoint and they began as soon as i arriv + had it done in under 45 minut . ye , pleas ! their wait room also ha wifi ! the servic wa so friendli and you can tell that they know what they 're do . there were custom in the wait room who had been bring their car here for year ! that is alway a good sign ! it wa such a refresh start to my friday morn . the best part , i alway <unk> when they come back to you with `` more thing '' that need to be taken care of but our car had a clean report ! yay ! ! we 'll be back thi fall !
realli disappoint in stay at thi hotel . i wa expect over the top decad . all i got wa over the top price for what i view as an averag hotel . i had a king suit which wa noth special . <unk> <unk> <unk> drink in the fridg . club are restaur turn into club with littl danc floor . shop and restaur are just ok ; expect more for the crazi price i paid . next time i 'm go back to the wynn which i think is a much better hotel .
place is extrem over price for what you are get in term of qualiti and quantiti of food . so i got the tortilla soup to stay cheap and it wa a shock $ 11 , for soup . we all decid to split a <unk> margarita on the rock with salt becaus it wa <unk> ounc at $ 35 <unk> the other margarita that were <unk> ounc were $ 11 and we figur that we we get a much better bang for our buck get the <unk> . the margarita wa strong , the food okay , and the servic rel <unk> we were not given much attent while we ate here .
liter everyth here is spici . it all tast great but the <unk> i through after is not worth it . i should at least be abl to order a not <unk> destroy option .
grab a bite here while befor head to the <unk> . it wa veri clean insid , and the man behind the counter wa great . interest mix of peopl seem to be on break for lunch from surround busi area . v casual and easi spot to grab and <unk> . the burrito wa <unk> soggi at the end , and end up look like <unk> even though it wa so so so delici while consum it . c'est la <unk> . hot box it and befor you go here it 's even better .
i wa at madison night market last night pig out at variou food truck . i came across el <unk> and a costa <unk> food truck with veri similar offer next to it . i had a hard time choos between them , so i flip a coin . i got ta say , i am so glad it land on tail . el <unk> wa serv a combo plate of the day and a sandwich call la tripleta . i got both : the plate of the day wa pork with <unk> <unk> rice and a choic of a side ( i pick savori fri banana aka toston ) . for $ 9 , i got a big <unk> fill gener with rice , pork , and toston . the rice wa delici savori and salti and also had some green oliv and what appear to be <unk> . the pork wa meati and <unk> with the perfect amount of fat . the spici , creami sauc on top gave the dish the <unk> it need . my onli complaint were that the pork wa bare too salti and that the toston were too thin , dri , and sweet . i 'm not go to lie , i wa realli look forward to good toston , so i wa pretti disappoint . la tripleta is absolut perfect . let 's start with the <unk> of ani good sandwich , the bread . they claim to bake the bread fresh everi day , and i believ it ! it wa perfectli soft and sweet . it wa like hawaiian bread and <unk> roll had a babi on <unk> . the meat mixtur of beef , pork , and chicken with mayo ketchup had a great meati and <unk> textur . the crunchi potato stick provid a nice textur <unk> . if you 're a fan of philli chees steak , you ca n't afford to pass up la tripleta . it 's a shame that el <unk> is mostli a lunch truck that i wo n't have access to . i 'll have to keep my eye peel for when it 's out for dinner time .
dish wa larg for an airport restaur . crab cake were good !

we were disappoint by thi place . the pastri , ( which we walk a decent distanc just to tri , hear that they were some of the best in <unk> ) were dri and hard . myself and my fiancé tri the blueberri danish , a regular croissant , chocol croissant and an almond chocol croissant and all were dri except for the danish , which wa the clear winner of the group . the fill wa delici and the pastri wa n't dri out and hard like the other . the coffe wa pretti good , not the best , and the tabl in the sit area upstair were a littl messi , but to be fair they look extrem busi ! i probabl would n't return , we had better pastri in other <unk> in montreal !
great servic , great price ! no hidden or ad fee , price less than a lot of compani that i look at , and amaz servic . the guy arriv on time , and work more than effici . they took great care of my belong and were veri profession . i definit recommend thi compani .
one of my favorit dish as a meat eater wa <unk> pie , so sinc i no longer eat meat i decid to tri it vegan style . all i can say is that it wa warm , satisfi and delici . i wa pleasantli surpris at the depth of flavor . as far as the cost at <unk> 's it is pricey but on the other hand you can feed two peopl with most dish they serv there . that includ their wonder bakeri item . i have eaten there on 3 occas and each time i have been more than happi with the food . my onli complaint is that it doe seem to take a while to get your food which is okay due to the qualiti , but if you ask for someth els , extra dure your meal it seem like you may never get it . then suddenli when you have about given up here it come . the staff there could not be nicer but they seem somewhat spread thin . oh and i want to mention almost everyth in their desert case is gluten free and the gluten free bread there is delish .
`` i 'll eat anyth if you are nice to me '' ... . '' and my favorit restaur 's are the one that are nicest to me '' ... so thi place ha a great <unk> and outstand food ! ! ! i am lucki enough to have been a number of time to <unk> 's new york , and what peopl do n't realiz is that what make it great is not just the food , but the warmth with which you are treat from frank <unk> and hi crew . you feel like you are famili in hi home . and he is quit a <unk> , and treat hi custom to that as well . well , i am not sure if frank <unk> can sing , but he <unk> the same warmth as hi dad . what a class act ! and the staff wa great . `` buffalo mike '' serv me at the bar , and could n't have been better . and the food wa just as good as in ny . they were film for the food network while i wa there , part of `` 10 best place to eat befor you die '' . watch it ! so what are you wait for ? you will feel right at home .
after month of anticip for their toronto open , i wa super excit to tri jelli modern doughnut . the jelli modern websit say that they `` <unk> the doughnut with <unk> flavour and high qualiti ingredi to creat a uniqu craft <unk> treat '' - sound amaz , right ? soft open wa today , and kiddo and i were there first thing ! the shop is realli cute , <unk> with lot of modern white , hot pink accent , and a pink `` velvet rope '' to manag those inevit lineup . we purchas 4 regular doughnut @ $ 2.75 each , and 2 `` three bite '' <unk> @ $ <unk> each . ( jelli doe n't charg tax on order of 6 or more . ) flavour purchas were : <unk> vanilla , coconut , <unk> , cinnamon-sugar , mapl bacon , and lemon curd . cinnamon-sugar is a cake doughnut , the other are all rais <unk> doughnut . cinnamon-sugar is coat in cinnamon and sugar of cours , and coconut ha coconut on the outsid , but all of the other doughnut sport a thick glaze or chocol coat . after sampl all these flavour , i have to say , i found these doughnut to be ... . not that excit . not exactli `` meh '' , but i 'm not crazi about them . i person find them to be a bit too doughi and veri <unk> . i prefer light , dri glaze ; and thi is more of a thick , wet glaze . i do n't want my glaze to be like ice or frost , i actual want glaze . doughnut peopl - it 's like a <unk> <unk> glaze - heavi and veri sweet . i 'm not a fan of <unk> <unk> 's , and i can take or leav these . as for the cake cinnamon-sugar doughnut , it seem almost <unk> , too crispi on the outsid , and lack anyth special about the crumb on the insid . on the plu side , it wa coat with just the right amount of cinnamon-sugar . my favorit flavour by far wa the coconut , with coconut cream and coconut on top . it wa truli delici . i will be go back for more coconut ! ! the biggest disappoint wa the lemon curd . i love a lemon curd doughnut , but thi lemon curd wa just <unk> , <unk> <unk> . with the addit of the doughi doughnut and veri thick glaze , the overal effect wa way too sweet and <unk> , not the littl bite of <unk> that lemon should be ! also wa hope for more from the mapl bacon - the mapl glaze is veri heavi and veri sweet ; the balanc with the <unk> salti good just wa n't there . ( dough toronto @ <unk> 's mapl bacon is a far <unk> doughnut in everi way . ) i love doughnut , and i think that 's one of the reason i 'm not so crazi about these - they actual remind me of cupcak , with the too sweet and the <unk> qualiti , they seem to have more in common with the cupcak than the doughnut . high qualiti ingredi ? sure . <unk> ? not so much . <unk> ? not realli . but if you like your doughnut to be more like cupcak , you will probabl love jelli modern . either way , it 's a nice addit to the toronto doughnut scene , go visit and tri them for yourself ! or check my doughnut list for other place to get your to doughnut fix . : )
just like my hamburg <unk> ... if you need too mani add on the meat must be lousi . actual the dog are ok , the chili sauc is essenti a <unk> greas slide so skip it unless you like that kind of <unk> <unk> . the texa toast approach is <unk> and work ... if your dog is not over <unk> with mustard etc . the more is better <unk> is so <unk> appli here that when ask for just mustard ( like a normal person ) and relish i wa <unk> with lettuc , mayo ! ! , two mustard and relish on the side . thi is one place that could realli benefit from robot order .
food wa great . i had the blt and fri . <unk> fri and veri larg portion . one of the best blt 's i have had . the bacon wa crispi and <unk> . they also have daili cupcak varieti made by a local <unk> . i have <unk> it to sever peopl alreadi .
busi , crowd , <unk> and a bit overpr . the food is delici . if i wa look to eat extrem <unk> and not care about price or calori , thi would be the place i would choos to do it at .
i order the number 9 , 2 chicken with bean and rice . the chicken taco were good , not great . the bean were veri bland . i feel they need to add more salt to their bean . the rice wa on the bland side as well . the interior wa spaciou and clean and <unk> kitchen look the same . i will not be come back becaus there are better choic than here .
onli complaint wa the wait but it wa worth the 20 min . got he turkey burger and the origin <unk> . amaz ! huge portion but we had a small breakfast and end up not eat dinner . share might be a good option if you 're not too hungri or want dinner later ! fri have a tasti season on them . pleasantli surpris at how amaz everyth wa .
i enjoy healthi smoothi where i can liter tast the leav that were blend insid . somehow , it make me feel healthier , and a littl better about myself . the smoothi here are veri fresh ( as you probabl get from the name ) and tast veri healthi . they come in a pretti larg size and they also give you a littl cup of extra ! the salad that they offer are pretti good , though they are <unk> . i had fun <unk> around the <unk> dress of my <unk> salad . i would n't say i wa full full when i finish my meal ( mayb i 'm just a fatti ) but i wa satisfi .
<unk> <unk> rock . the food is a work of art and tast amaz . the decor and servic is awesom . it is a min of <unk> hr that you will be sit there but it is worth it . the 16 cours meal will take 3 plu hr ( my father walk out in the middl of it becaus it wa too long ) . i would recommend the 7 cours over the 16 ( my father did n't finish the 7 either ) . if you want to impress a date then thi is the place .
thi place is clean and serv good food . i have come on multipl occas with my boyfriend and each time we have love it . the first time i got their grill beef sandwich and then the second time i go the pho . i have a place i use to go but it so far now but find thi place ha been awesom . their broth is <unk> and everyth tast fresh . i also order their mango smoothi and it wa one of the best smoothi i have ever had . it wa creami and tast just like eat a mango . alway come here when i get a pho crave
visit thi place becaus we receiv a $ 100.00 voucher for sit through a two hour time share present . win ! right ? not exactli . the wife and i had been to a <unk> the weekend befor in san <unk> , and we 're blown away . we hope that for the fact it 's in vega , <unk> to be much better . we arriv on time for a <unk> reserv , and we 're told to wait anoth 15 minut . no problem , sat at the bar for a while . we were final seat 30 minut later , and wait 10 minut for our server . final the floor manag took our drink order . the salad bar wa not as good as place i 've been in the past . the onli item i like were the deep fri banana and chees bread . some item i usual enjoy , mash potato , tempura , and caesar salad all fell short . the meat came around <unk> . initi onli 4 cut came around on a regular basi , without see ani other meat . we eventu told those guy to stop come , and told the manag . <unk> other cut came around , and we becam frustrat . i do n't think either of us got out fill . the qualiti of the meat wa poor . noth stood out except for bacon wrap turkey , but then again how can you mess up bacon . we spoke with the manag again , and he comp us desert . i had the cheesecak which wa `` okay '' . i would not come here again unless i ha anoth voucher , and if i did i would drink a lot of beer and fill up on fri banana .
the food is awesom , love the three cup chicken , crispi tofu and the beef noodl soup .

thi wa bad even for thi place . we stop in at the end of the even for a nice chocol martini and an appet . the servic wa slow , not her fault , but have more staff on the floor would have help . our drink final show up and they are horribl . horribl ! our appet come and we had to send two back . one tast like smoke and other smell spoil , wa soggi and greasi . we final got to speak with a manag and noth wa done about it and he did n't seem that apologet . we will not be return .

i too would also stay away from home manag by <unk> . respons wa okay , get into the rental wa n't too bad , and our home wa a new properti so there wa n't much wrong with it . when it came time for deposit return , we hire cleaner and left the place cleaner than it wa when we move in , but a singl <unk> of dog hair trap in a corner wa use to claim it wa n't clean enough . also they claim their guy said he had to remov a smoke smell when <unk> one- smoke in that hous , ever . so they took most of our deposit and left us with a <unk> $ 150 . you can see their post here are a sort of damag control , but none of them apolog for ani confus or what may have happen and are entir defens . expect the same when you get screw .
you know that feel when you go to a restaur and you do n't want to give it a bad review ? well , today is one of those day . the food wa sub par . we had order the guacamol which wa pretti good . my fiancé order the carn asada taco which were better than the al pastor taco i order . mine were bland and dri . our waitress howev wa on anoth planet . she wa one of those waitress who tri to impress you by take your order but not write it down . i have to admit , i do get impress when waitress do that , but i 'm not impress when they swing by 15 minut after take our order to make sure she rememb it correctli ( thi wa done throughout the night ) . i also got annoy how they would offer to bring chip but never did and we also wait forev for our food that should have onli taken 10 to 15 minut to make . fyi : the restaur wa n't even busi , 8 peopl were there max on a monday night at <unk> . be a foodi , i realli dislik write bad review but if i had n't had such crappi servic , or did n't have to wait forev for food that i had order , i think i would have had a better experi .
great experi , averag food . as mention the place can be loud but thi is becaus of the other peopl around you and not the restaur itself . peopl tend to talk a lot and veri loud becaus they do n't see anyon . it seem like they are afraid they will <unk> to exist if they can not be heard . despit thi i enjoy myself it wa a fun experienc eat a meal in that manner . the food wa ok without be amaz . noth wa cold and the servic wa great . thi is a place that i would definit recommend that you tri onc , but beyond be a <unk> dinner for friend who have never been there , i can not see myself dine there again .
food wa okay . servic from <unk> not so friendli and person if you are compar it to the other gentleman waiter . she never took the time to greet us and explain special or come back to check on us period . when we ask her question , it wa like we bother her . if it wa n't for the other waiter be so nice to the other tabl , i would not come back here .
we do n't live in ohio and onli stumbl across thi fantast deli becaus we were stay across the street at a hotel . it wa graduat weekend for case western , so the area wa busi . they seat us right away . the first thing we notic is all the pictur of food on the wall that we realli want to <unk> everi singl thing we order live up to the hype of the other review . we even let the cream puff pictur <unk> our dessert select . we are return around new year for a mini vacat to the area - definit return here !

my first <unk> restaur ! ! ! my girlfriend took me here as a surpris , and what a surpris it wa . i had honestli not heard of guy savoy befor but just a brief googl search found these <unk> : the la vega restaur ha <unk> 2 michelin star , the aaa five diamond award , the <unk> five star award , and the wine <unk> grand award . wow ! what a resum . as soon as i learn where i wa go , suddenli my expect shot up <unk> high . never have been at a <unk> restaur befor , i wa n't exactli sure what to expect , but the french <unk> here did not disappoint . we check in and were seat immedi . the waiter provid us everi courtesi imagin , some i had never seen extend befor : <unk> , ladi are given a stool for their <unk> . what ? even your <unk> get a seat here . on the tabl are absolut gorgeou salt and pepper contain , and the <unk> you get for your drink are just stun . between dish , they will clear your tabl of ani crumb . wow ! i must be realli show my <unk> side right now . at the start of the meal , they will ask about ani dietari concern and time <unk> . the servic they provid just blew my mind . they are clearli on top of their shit . even the restroom are beauti . now let 's talk about the food 1 . <unk> <unk> - lobster candi , seawe <unk> : basic a singl bite of lobster wrap in seawe . slightli sweet with all the flavor of the lobster there . great way to kick start your appetit . 2 . <unk> , frozen cauliflow mouss - imagin eat shave ice , but it 's actual cauliflow . pair with <unk> and <unk> milk skin , thi remind me more of a dessert than an entre , but extrem delici nonetheless . 3 . <unk> tartar , black truffl <unk> carrot <unk> , <unk> quail egg - wow ! the present of thi dish just exceed all my expect . they pour some water <unk> the dish where it hit some dri ice and creat a veri beauti steam effect . pictur do n't do thi ani <unk> tbh . the dish itself is veri good . ca n't go wrong with quail egg . 4 . salmon iceberg - thi wa almost more of a show than a meal , and boy i wa love it . the execut chef came out with a cart of <unk> , then prepar one piec of salmon for each of us by season it on a block of <unk> pink salt . he explain that he want us to see how the salmon tast just by itself ( it wa amaz ) . after that he prepar one more piec each . he took the salmon and sear it right in front of us on a block of dri ice . wow . i did n't even know you could do that . after it 's sear , they place it on your plate and pour a hot broth on top so you can tast the <unk> of the cold and the heat . i regret not get a video of the whole process becaus it wa such an amaz experi . 5 . sea bass , crispi scale , sauerkraut , and <unk> oyster - both the sea bass and oyster are extrem flavor . just by itself , it 's extrem moist and soft . with the scale and sauerkraut , you get the crunchi textur . 6 . foie gra , pickl turnip , <unk> <unk> infus - to be honest , i do n't think i 've ever had foie gra befor . my god , it 's like a crazi cross between butter and steak . i heard it wa illeg in california ( where i 'm from ) till recent , so i will definit be seek more out ! wow , so good . 7 . artichok and black truffl soup , toast mushroom brioch and black truffl butter - <unk> , <unk> ' out <unk> black truffl butter is so crazi good . pair with the brioch , wow . then pair that with the black truffl soup , wow . 8 . <unk> quail , stuf babi turnip , and smoke <unk> - my vote for the <unk> dish here . the meat is extrem flavor and succul . the babi turnip is cut so you can pop <unk> of that sucker into your mouth . the quail wa <unk> , then <unk> for present lol . i think that 's pretti cool . the <unk> just add so much flavor on top of that . 9 . japanes wagyu , sesam seed , and <unk> crust , artichok salad and <unk> , spong cake - the dish 's present is veri clean but actual there is so much go on here . the artichok salad and spong cake combo is not someth i 've ever experienc befor so that wa veri interest . the wagyu wa pure <unk> . i 'm not an expert meat <unk> but even a guy like me and tell the differ between a high qualiti cut like thi and everyth els . 10 . black truffl <unk> : you just pop that sucker in . it 's suppos to be eaten in a singl bite ! <unk> . dessert + dessert cart . sorri as much as i 'd love to describ these to you all , i hit yelp 's charact limit . let 's just say they do n't suck . close thought - thi wa the best meal i 've ever had in my entir life . it 's no surpris that thi restaur is so highli decor in award . if you are fortun enough to be abl to afford an even , i highli recommend it . serious a memori for a lifetim .

aria ha it own coffe shop near the entranc from the <unk> garag call the roast bean . although thi is the same roast bean brand as it is in the mirag ( henc it wa carri over ) , i find thi to be a littl bit nicer . perhap becaus it is newer , and perhap becaus they charg more but the pastri / muffin and the coffe here just tast better for some reason despit be onli a few door away from the mirag . the coffe is expens , two soy latt ( one small , one larg ice ) will cost you a <unk> $ <unk> some chang . if you want a muffin , it will cost you $ <unk> some chang . thi is not a place for the light heart coffe drinker . you have to love . your . coffe . and need it badli enough to pay for it here when you can easili find an <unk> in palazzo or coffe bean in the venetian . howev , the staff wa friendli , the coffe wa good ( they serv <unk> coffe here ... `` premium '' i suppos ) and despit the price , no complaint .

sooo barriqu . as some of you may know ... i freakin love barriqu . i must hold down my excit to review thi particular locat though . barriqu coffe , tea , and treat ? excel thi particular locat ha a lot go for it and some not so much . the thing i like most about it , is the locat and the interior . thi locat is found right smack <unk> on the corner of fish <unk> road and park street which is a huge travel <unk> near downtown madison . plenti of sit space , some comfi chair and even a <unk> area that seem ... i do n't know , quaint . it is n't super busi everi time i have been here but it is n't dead either . staff ha been sometim inattent and onc or twice downright rude but it onli happen onc or twice so i wo n't hold it against them . they also have an internet area in the back i think . i tend to stay toward the front of the store so i am not sure but i thought that wa a realli nice addit . 9 out of 10 time the store is <unk> and final it is n't <unk> . now onto some not so nice thing ( sad face ) . so the thing i dislik most about thi locat are 1. the bathroom , and ye i know it seem <unk> but if you read some of my other review thi can make or break it . it is n't alway as clean as it could be to put it nice . anoth issu i have , iron enough , is the locat . i know i said i enjoy the locat and i do but it is right on the main drag so if you are there on a nice summer day or around <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , all you will see is <unk> traffic . which , if you are tri to relax , is not the first thing that spring to mind . the other issu is that it doe n't seem to be as busi as it should be for be where it is . whi is n't that place pack all day ! the reason i have found for thi is that there is not much park without walk a bit , which is great in the summer mayb or if your younger , but not so much in the winter . there is street park but it is <unk> so much that you would end up move your car anyway . they have about 6 spot along the back of store but that it . so becaus i love their coffe and atmospher so much thi place get a difficult 5 star . the reason if becaus i do n't want to have to park on a greatli busi street and cleanli of the bathroom . otherwis ? great staff , free wifi , great coffe , great decor , great food , and great coffe ... oh did i say they had great coffe too ?

went for the first time last week when benni <unk> ( love him ! ) wa <unk> and it wa one of my favorit thing in vega thu far ! the crowd is chill , it a great environ , and as long as you 're a girl and look good you get in free . the waiter are friendli and you 're not go to be stuck without a drink look for someon , they 're on top of it ! there 's no where to realli sit unless you reserv a tent or chair so the best thing to do is get there earlier so you can get a spot in the pool by the wall . honestli though it realli doe n't matter much it 's just such an awesom spot that if you 're stuck in the middl of the pool you 're still have a great time .

we had a meet with the properti manag today and feel that our concern were <unk> resolv . <unk> seem to be the <unk> issu , especi with <unk> date and time - we were shown the <unk> that prove we were <unk> for <unk> . the leas wa not readi becaus the <unk> onli come in to sign them onc per week - which we did n't know and now understand . the <unk> floor wa suppos to start on thursday when we were home and wa not suppos to take 3 day to complet - thi wa an issu with the individu perform the work and not commun with the front offic at <unk> ridg . <unk> also said the carpet will also be <unk> - the spot and stain are due to the replac of applianc post carpet <unk> , but <unk> our <unk> . mainten item note on our <unk> are due to be address today , and the carpet is schedul for later thi week . i am extrem happi with thi resolut of event . <unk> wa profession in address my concern and we now have open <unk> of commun to ensur that misunderstand do not <unk> in the futur . to review the properti itself : the apart is spaciou and love , the fire place is a great bonu , and my balconi overlook some wood so it 's veri <unk> and peac . i paid for an upgrad packag to get all new <unk> steel applianc and brush <unk> fixtur - highli recommend , it realli make a differ . you can hear water run in the pipe all over the build , but that 's normal . we veri rare hear our neighbor , despit some other review to the <unk> . the <unk> are veri messi , with individu dump furnitur and mattress and trash all over the ground . thi is n't realli <unk> ridg 's fault , but the <unk> of peopl who will leav a mess like that is the type of peopl you will be live with . overal , i realli like thi complex and plan to stay beyond the first year 's leas .
good food and deliveri time wa reason . we call 5 minut befor close and they <unk> took my order .
aw servic . we order brunch for 3 and wait for over 50 minut befor cancel . when we ask about our food , the cook yell at us and told us to go to <unk> . i 'll never go back .

liter almost die walk here from the strip ( but it wa total worth it ) . my boyfriend claim it wa `` right down the street '' but realli i would suggest get an uber becaus it 's a trek and the <unk> you have to cross are kinda danger . anyway , we came around noon and it wa <unk> . like line out the door . but they run the place supper effici so order are come out super quick . my burger wa hot and super fresh and everyth in n out claim to be . end up get back on line for anoth lol . enough said ! ! ! p. . i like how they have fresh lemon at the drink station .
thi escap room is pretti uniqu amongst the few that i have done . they have differ kind of puzzl than you might expect and they are good about get you <unk> in the <unk> . our group wa on the smaller side so we got put togeth with anoth smaller group in the room ; keep that in mind if you do n't like be pair with stranger . if i wa from vega i 'd definit want them to have more room ( there are onli 2 , <unk> in stori , but you do n't necessarili have to play them in order ) becaus they have a win <unk> . on the <unk> side as well , so steel yourself ! the locat look sketchi but we did n't have ani problem find the place and they have dedic park . the staff wa friendli and profession and there are some <unk> <unk> for you to keep thing like your <unk> in , so you do n't have to worri about what to do with ani of your thing .

great atmospher , good food , not the most attent servic ... so to start thing out with the most posit ... thi is an nice littl spot hidden just off the main road but quit possibl overlook . the atmospher is clean and invit with a nice dimli lit environ that prepar you for a relax meal . we found thi place in groupon where there wa a $ 40 gift certif for onli $ 20 which make tri a place out <unk> ! we arriv and were promptli seat in the back room in the corner . i came to the conclus that the staff doe n't notic you often in the corner ... . water is refil at half cup by the roam water <unk> ... the food wa a solid enjoy 4 of 5 star ... it wa tasti and good , but not an explos of great ... definit worth the price and the visit . order desert requir more than 10 minut of watch the waiter visit each tabl but our as i wave and attempt to <unk> hi attent ... . final he came ask we ask for the dessert menu but here is no actual menu so he <unk> gave it to us ... we order two dessert and coffe to end the night . get coffe wa n't easi ... the dessert came out and still no coffe . after a bit the waiter said he wa make some coffe for us and then it arriv . then we had to wait for real sugar sinc they brought a tray of chemic sugar substitut that we would n't use ... final the coffe arriv and we drank it ... nobodi brought us refil of the coffe so we paid and left ... .
fish wa raw when came home from takeout ! ! ! hope we do n't get sick . <unk> ... <unk> did get sick ... <unk> them no one answer ... <unk> servic
so ... everyon ha heard of thi place by now right ? ? thi restaur is fantast and that 's probabl whi it 's been part of the strip scene sinc <unk> . the atmospher is uniqu ... <unk> in a way that remind me of the <unk> day and vintag vega . their menu even say `` some thing are better left <unk> '' and when it come to what they do at the peppermil , they 're right ! they do n't need to chang a thing and if they ever did , it may be the worst move ever . the menu is extens , and the portion are larg and i mean larg . it 's done on purpos to <unk> what vega use to do befor <unk> by the `` big guy '' set in . the food is pretti <unk> , and seem pretti <unk> in qualiti . the ambianc alon get the 5-star . if you go to vega and do n't tri the peppermil , you 'd be do yourself a great <unk> and it may even result it a display of your own <unk> . note : the compani that own peppermil also ha a peppermil casino in reno , western villag casino in <unk> , and oper a small casino call rainbow club in henderson .
at first we were promis all kind of <unk> & such from an offic worker . come to find out she told us wrong , but the manag wa nice enough to stand behind their word . our apart wa unbeliev disgust when we move in . we were move from iowa , so you can imagin how a first impress is when you are promis everyth wa look through twice and wa suppos to be in `` mint condit . '' the floor were brown downstair , carpet had hair and safeti pin in them , but were said to be shampoo , the dishwash wa replac , but not measur becaus when you tri to open the door it broke the cabinet . the <unk> were bust , drain <unk> , outlet <unk> are loos , blind broken , patio not maintain and full of <unk> tree is fall onto the back door . our washer and dryer ha been broken sinc we move in a month ago ! they tri to fix it onc and did not work , so i sent in anoth order and 14 day later they came to check it out and noth ha been done . they said that if the first fix did n't happen they would order a new one . a new one should have been order in the first place sinc it should have been fix when we move in . btw it 's still not fix . they said they would pay for us to do our <unk> in the public area , but if we are pay rent to have it in unit then it should be fix no later than 10 day . the back patio door had a lock on it from the last tenant . my dad is a <unk> and notifi them that it is a safeti <unk> , becaus if there wa a fire and we could n't get out the front way , then we would be trap becaus of the lock . he ask for it to be remov immedi . they took a day and would have been longer if my dad did n't go back up there and demand for it to be off , becaus the fire <unk> would not <unk> of that . <unk> ridicul that thi wa miss by 2 peopl from a said inspect . our washer and dryer ha been broken for a month and our patio still ha not been clean when promis for it to be done today . promis have not been kept and it is such a shame when you move from somewher have such high hope . my last <unk> had over 500 properti in iowa citi and if we put a mainten request in they would have it fix by 5 day and came the next day . not to mention they onli had 2 mainten guy handl all 500 properti . so what 's the deal arcadia <unk> ? whi ca n't you come within 10 day to fix someth ? i do n't see ani logic excus if 2 mainten men can manag 500 properti and answer to request in 5 day or less ! also , noth but pay for our <unk> ha been <unk> for <unk> convers and the headach of someth that should have been taken care of befor we move in . i have dealt with crappi <unk> befor ( place with black mold ) and those <unk> were much better with respond and to deal with . the <unk> are nice if everyth get fix and should have been fix , but bewar if someth break ... the <unk> of it get fix is veri <unk> .
great light design in the interior space with <unk> seat , but it is n't veri larg and doe feel a bit <unk> . there is also a pool area outsid and individu hot tub for some of the cabana . i did n't particularli care for the elev ride up though ( think tao ) . the drink were <unk> and servic staff were good .

befor go tonight , we heard from a friend that thi restaur wa realli great and delici . unfortun , that wa not the case when we went thi even . four of us cousin went out to celebr a birthday . we made a reserv and were seat just fine . it took about 15 minut for anyon to come ask for our drink order . we order and then wait liter an hour for our food . we were told they were back up in the kitchen so we were n't freak out too much ... howev , my cousin and i both order the ahi <unk> bowl , and they were both brought out with hard rice that had bare been cook . appar the whole <unk> had been undercook and no one had notic befor send it out . we kept have to flag peopl down becaus all of the server were <unk> move about the restaur . we expect to have been <unk> in some way , but noth wa taken off of the bill . it wa ridicul . the onli save grace wa that our waiter wa nice and tri hi best to make up for the kitchen staff be behind . but for a restaur old town scottsdal i wa not impress . i will definit not be go back .

definit not as bad as some of the review suggest . the best part of thi airport restaur is the locat . it 's right there and ha a great crowd and the seat is spread out , with mani larg screen tv . and the food wa n't too <unk> either . i 'd go back . the mac n chees wa good - miss some <unk> , but whatev . and the salad wa yummi . the sandwich were order were good too . but the highlight and memor item ... . all sandwich come with fri , onion ring , or ... .. fri zucchini stick . yum ! perfect and crispi , with a great dip sauc . perfect sport bar item . servic wa n't bad for us - slow perhap - but the <unk> our server had wa incred . one man for the entir <unk> area seat , way too much for him , but he manag it well and wa nice too .
thi place is realli amaz . i come here for brunch or dinner pretti much everi vega trip i go on and i 've got to say that it 's been consist good . the wine list is pretti stellar and the bar tender are realli knowledg about what pair with what and they do their best to give you tast befor you buy . the price for wine vari from inexpens to more than what i make in a week . i 've never been disappoint by ani of the wine or cocktail that i 've tri here . which are numer . food : the fri ! ! ! so good . they 're the <unk> littl one and they 're wonder . i got the mussel and fri and the sauc for the mussel wa to die for ! i also got the lamb over a bean <unk> and i wa disappoint with that dish . way too much salt and the bean did n't make sens with the <unk> they were almost the same textur which wa a littl weird . the lamb wa so tender that it wa almost shock ! we for sure finish that ! my friend got the scallop entre and it wa phenomen ! ! serious ! veri rich though . it wa small , onli two or three scallop , but becaus of the rich , we could n't eat ani more than that anyway . we also got some mussel and <unk> as a starter and the sauc that came with them were outstand . the price were reason for cold seafood too . we also tri the french onion soup and i have to say , it 's the best i 've ever had . it 's larg though , so i could have eaten it for dinner alon ! ! ! if you 're look for a beauti escap from the cigarett smoke and <unk> card on the vega strip , come to bouchon which is a littl french oasi .
i typic love thi place . i came here on a thursday at <unk> . the place wa empti , normal i 'm here on a weekend morn when it 's busi . all my food wa ice cold when they gave it to me . it also tast super old . whi ? there wa n't anybodi in here ! terribl .
thi place ha veri littl park , it noisi and dark , it small . the caesar salad is noth special and the calamari wa chewi . with all that , thi place is awesom <unk> . the steak wa incred and if you do n't get the bacon on it you are a fool . it is the most delici bacon i 've ever had . the side are nice as well . the beat is that if you eat there befor 8 you get half off your steak . thi onli add to the enjoy . thi place is fun , crowd , and ha phenomen steak . just be prepar to park in a shadi alley .
we have eaten here befor but thi last time wa one of the worst experi ever . keep in mind it wa not busi at thi hour . we walk in and were greet right away and quickli seat . after wait 10 minut someon casual drop off 4 water but noth els . at thi point we had wait 15 minut but still had no idea who our waiter wa . we final ask the ladi in the front to be move into anoth section and she quickli sat us somewher els . after that we had to wait anoth 20 minut for food and final ate after what felt like forev . thi wa an aw experi and the manag came over and just apolog and walk away . he did n't say anyth els , did n't ask us if we need anyth . it wa a veri disappoint experi especi becaus we have eaten here mani time befor . on the bright side the food wa good .
went to the happi hour thi afternoon with my husband and we were veri disappoint in the bad servic and terribl food . we were tri to decid between lush burger and red <unk> -- should have gone with red <unk> . the $ 6.00 happi hour margarita tast like straight <unk> mix . first time in my entir life that i have sent a drink back to the bar ! we each order burger medium rare and and after a long wait of about 20 minut our food arriv . burger were overcook hockey <unk> on larg <unk> brioch bun . they onli gave us one littl portion of ketchup to share . we ask for mayo and ranch and the server onli brought us one of each to share . when the server ask how our food wa i show her my burger and she said she wa sorri that it wa <unk> and if i want to send it back . i pass sinc we had alreadi been there such a long time . $ 40 is a alot to spend on poor food and terribl servic . no one from manag ever came to our tabl to follow up on our complaint about the drink or the burger . thi place is aw and i would n't be surpris it it went out of busi soon . never again . do n't wast your time and money on thi lousi place .

yay ! final a hawaiian bbq place closer to where i live . i hate drive so far just to get some from <unk> rose on tropicana . appar thi place had been under construct and is now <unk> . the restaur is huge and <unk> with the old american diner look . you have the option of sit by the counter on stool or in the littl booth with the <unk> chair ! there wa ac too so i felt <unk> comfi . the menu they have offer a lot of thing that typic hawaiian bbq place do , from the bbq combin platter , spam musubi , bbq burger , etc . they also offer a `` <unk> '' menu for low carb eater , and a section if you would like to switch out for brown rice instead . they have 2 size in which you can order , the `` mini '' or the `` regular '' . the mini come with onli one scoop of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad , the regular come with 2 scoop of rice and 2 scoop of macaroni salad . <unk> is what the cashier told me so correct me if i 'm wrong ! * i order the bbq combin plate which ha the bbq chicken , bbq beef , and short rib , the bf order the bbq burger and spam musubi . we decid to eat at the restaur so we could enjoy the ac and comfi chair . the tabl have sriracha , and <unk> brand hawaiian soy sauc , yum ! our order came and i wa surpris that the food still came in a styrofoam box even though we order to dine in , but oh well , it will be easier to take home leftov . my food wa delici , so much meat and my macaroni salad wa good also . i think my favorit wa the bbq beef , they were yummi and thin and flavor , remind me of the steak or brisket you get from pho haha . my bf enjoy hi bbq burger but enjoy hi spam musubi way more , he enjoy it so much he tell me to make some so he can take to work now . great , now i need to find a musubi mold and hawaiian soy sauc . servic wa good , though the cashier girl could smile a bit more or be a bit more cheer ? the gentleman wa nice enough to give me a free refil , so <unk> <unk> ! thi place is go in my <unk> so i can definit come back here again . : )
except servic . open past 10pm for late dinner . i wa in la vega for my birthday weekend and my friend and i were look for a nice dinner at 10pm . it is hard to find a steakhous open past 10pm but we found <unk> 's and i am so thank . we start with the lobster cocktail and it is huge . the lobster claw went past my expect . and mash potato and brussel sprout with our 22 oz ribey . the onli bad thing is the locat , it is right in the mall which i am not a fan of , but it is conveni locat on the strip . and the <unk> is beauti and modern .
dive bar , for sure . i 've onli been at lunchtim - but the beer select would not get me to come after work . anyway - i <unk> ... i 'm a huge fan of the lunch special . a few of us from work come here like <unk> ( ye , i 'm bet you could set your watch base on our arriv ) on friday . monday through friday , they have 4 daili special . sandwich and fri , or a salad for $ 5 . five buck . our pathet littl group consist get the french dip on friday . ye ... all four of us . and , can i say it ? ? i would not typic order a salad from a dive bar . i 'd pictur crappi veggi , and probabl <unk> iceberg lettuc . my girlfriend order a salad , and i wa look at it with lot of interest . so much so that she start move her plate closer to her side of the tabl . : ) the waitstaff is interest . the one regular girl is quick , and understand that we are on lunch , and <unk> our stuff to us , and get refil and check out quickli . luckili , we usual get her . she 's a <unk> . the other girl ... well ... <unk> ... yeah . thi past summer ... she wore veri veri short <unk> skirt . so short in fact , that when she came out onto the patio , walk toward our tabl , we could clearli see her hot pink <unk> ( god , i <unk> that word ) <unk> at us from under the skirt . my buddi that wa sit eye level to her <unk> as she came <unk> up to the tabl is still excit . so , there ya go . if you go on a friday , you 'll see us there around <unk> . we are a loud and happi bunch . say hi ! : )
thi review is for breakfast . the food and servic were excel compar to other casual restaur on the strip and for be in a hotel . first , the pipe hot strong coffe come in these larg <unk> which are perfect . the first day we had the all natur omelet made out of butter less egg white and veggi ( no meat ) and the breakfast sandwich . both were well prepar with qualiti ingredi and tast delici . the second day we want to come back for the french toast which look amaz . we were not <unk> full of butter and the right amount of sweet and accompani with warm syrup ( a nice touch ) . we also had the <unk> <unk> which wa full of marin steak and no bean ! the portion are just right and you wo n't leav be hungri . the price are reason ( for the strip and be in a hotel ) ... most of the entre are $ <unk> $ 17 . breakfast for two will run you about $ 40 plu tip . that may seem high but be from san francisco it wa n't that much that more . go to the henri if you want qualiti , well execut food and servic .
we came here with my sister and my brother in law . we love korean bbq and thi place did n't disappoint . we love that there were sever option of appet to choos from on the unlimit menu as well . my husband and brother in law love the shrimp <unk> the best . they probabl had about 4 plate . the onli reason i did n't give 5 star is becaus i order a corn chees that i never receiv .
i am surpris at some of the low review of thi place . i almost did n't tri it which would have been a mistak . the servic wa veri friendli and a lot <unk> than i had expect base on previou review . the restaur itself wa clean , comfort , and had a comfort nois level in <unk> of be fairli busi . the food wa great and when it come to varieti ca n't be beat . i had the <unk> cheeseburg on a wheat bun . the bun wa grill and delici but i had to <unk> most of it otherwis i never would have been abl to eat as much of the burger as i did . the medium size fri wa too big for a parti of two so next time i will tri the small . we were also veri happi to have the shake and malt come in a half size which wa much more manag than the usual size you get in restaur . we will definit be back .
thi is a great littl place - veri cozi even though it is much larger than it look . i wa impress with the food and the beer . definit go there again ...
i receiv quick and friendli servic at lunch hour for a sit down . i had the origin ramen du <unk> . it wa good and in good portion . i enjoy it . you get a whole egg which wa a nice surpris becaus most place , <unk> . live in nyc you get half !
we keep go to the same plaza to eat pizza but i want someth differ today . thi wa our first time here . we order the vegetarian poutin , and the gravi wa a mushroom gravi . the place wa nice but i found it a littl dark . not sure if they want that as effect or for the ambianc . we went there on a tuesday afternoon and the place wa not that busi . we were serv quickli . i enjoy my poutin . could not eat all at one sit becaus we order a larg poutin . the portion wa huge . both my son and i like it . we will be come back in the near futur .

excel local shawarma place . the chicken wrap and <unk> stew are particularli good .
decent place for sushi ! got the bento box dinner , and includ tax and tip , the meal wa under $ 20 . first , we got miso soup ( which i found to be too salti ) . the salad wa good - pretti acid but i like that . then they gave edamam bean for the tabl ( free appet , yay ! ) . the bento box itself wa quit nice . i realli like how it came with seawe salad . i 've never gotten that in a bento box befor . it also came with half a spring roll . the salmon teriyaki wa yummi - a bit burnt in part , but the flavour and textur wa good . i substitut the white rice for brown rice ( $ 1 extra ) , which i enjoy . the california roll tast a bit off ... wa n't sure what it wa about them . but it 's enough for me not to order ani california roll from here if i ever come back . tri some of the kalbi beef my friend order , as well as the tempura . both were pretti decent . at the end , they give you complimentari fruit , and candi with your bill . you get lot of extra eat here , which is nice ! food is pretti good , and spaciou place to hang out .
just call the emerg ac servic and they would n't come out becaus i have a home warranti . i told them i had no intent of use my home warranti ( it take to long for someon to come out ) , i just want it fix asap and am will to pay . he did n't give two <unk> even tho we live in az and the temp in my hous is 100 . not veri human .
i stop go after they mix up my <unk> . i wish i felt welcom there and that they took the time to build trust .
i love coffe , and thi is certainli one of the best cafe in the <unk> area . i come here often : i 've had their americano , espresso , <unk> , and their latt . everyth is amaz . grant , i 've never had their pastri , but they do look pretti yummi . they make their coffe product with coffe from <unk> and <unk> coffe roaster , which is a <unk> coffe roaster from calgari . their servic is quick and <unk> everi time , and i would not hesit to recommend thi spot for some good coffe . it 's quit cozi insid , and it could ( arguabl ) use more space , but there are two floor if the first floor is full . they also sell bag of coffe , from roaster like <unk> <unk> ( out of <unk> ) , cut coffe roaster ( out of toronto ) and of cours , <unk> and <unk> . great place !
perhap one of the cheapest restaur in cleveland , the big egg ha a reput as a <unk> late night spot . the love interior doe not live up to thi reput : it 's actual quit nice . it 's locat near <unk> street and <unk> on cleveland 's west side . i got the chicken parm dinner ( pictur on my <unk> : http : <unk> ) and it came with soup and ice cream for dessert . it wa delici , <unk> , and total <unk> . my friend got the salmon burger and clean her plate . the diet coke flow . refil came and came . <unk> <unk> play in the background . dinner came with a littl cup of ice cream for dessert , which wa an unexpect delight . there were a coupl of love famili dine there on the sunday night we went ... none of the <unk> of 600 lb waitress or <unk> drunk prove to be true . the food , howev , wa <unk> cheap diner food .

i call late in the afternoon when one of our unit had stop . they came out veri quickli and spent a good coupl hour tri to fix the unit , but , could n't . i decid to replac both unit sinc they were 14 year old and got 4 differ quot from variou compani . <unk> of air 's quot wa one of the <unk> and combin with the veri profession sale experi with jerri , made it an easi choic . they were also abl to do the instal the next day . the instal process and crew were top notch as well . i wish i could thank them all by name as they did an outstand job . the <unk> unit are oper great and we are cool onc again . it 's also nice to know that we have a 10 year warranti as well .
i have a feel thi place will not be around much longer . so i have been to the <unk> <unk> room twice . the first time wa with a larg group of friend right around when it had just open . we met <unk> <unk> and hi wife and tri almost everyth on the menu . had great servic and great food . the place wa hop too . the <unk> theme is realli cool , you want to just hang out . and have some weird cocktail . 4 star experi . the second time , we had famili in town and thought it 'd be a fun place to take them . it wa a friday night around 7 and the place wa surprisingli dead but the music wa realli loud , so do n't expect to hold a decent convers here . i tri to order one of their specialti drink but were out of one of the ingredi ... boo ! we order some app and larg plate . the thing i wa most excit about get again were the chicken pot pie <unk> . they were good , but someth wa differ , i think it 's the outsid coat , they just did n't make me crave them again like they did the first time . we ate all of our food , it wa good , ... but just not as good as that first time . the servic wa so-so . 3 star experi . i 'd tell you what we got and tell you how it wa but i do n't feel like it 's worth my time or your . if you have to go , get a drink and mayb one app , snap some pictur . then get out of there , <unk> bay is full of better place to eat . i can say that i got it out of my system , i do n't need to go back , even if they are still open a year from now ( which i doubt . )
the corn beef hash wa decent . but it lack the hearti that a good hangov breakfast call for . the potato were <unk> . not hash brown like .
been tempt by the review for a few week now , my husband keep talk about them , we knew we 'd be head here today , it wa slider day ! thi place is hidden in a group of build that look empti or close dure the weekend . onc in the park lot , you think you 're head into a bar , but onc in the door , a quick turn to the right and you 're in <unk> ' thru <unk> ! it 's color , full of surpris , video game , big screen tv , <unk> on the wall , and today no one els around , we look over the small select and make our choic of three : <unk> , captain order and pep pep , it seem thi combin is order frequent , what better way to tast the differ and decid on your favorit ? the least like , captain order , it wa differ , the arugula , feta chees and balsam <unk> went well togeth , but i am an old fashion burger lover , so i want someth simpl . my favorit , pep pep , it 's most like my idea of a burger , simpl , bacon lettuc , tomato , onion , pickl , and sauc . could n't leav without tri some fri , the captain order someth differ , fri , smother with bacon , chees , onion , and special sauc , it tast like tartar sauc , someth that would go good with my fish burger , i did n't realli care for thi . i know we 'll be back , there are other thing on the menu like the pull pork and the sweet potato fri i want to tri . at least i now know what to expect and if the <unk> is there , it 'll be worth a return trip .

as thi walgreen is my regular <unk> , i chose thi locat to get a flu shot at . when i arriv at the pharmaci there were no custom so i thought i 'd be in and out in a breez but 20 minut later , i wa still wait for the shot . after give the first pharmaci employe my insur inform i wa told to have a seat and that she 'd get the paperwork that i 'd need to fill out in order to have the <unk> give me the flu shot . as anoth 10 minut pass with no paperwork to fill out , i watch the 3 employe answer phone , help custom that walk in and those that came through the drive thru . it truli wa not busi , but it appear that flu shot were not prioriti one , two or three to these employe . perhap these <unk> valu the servic of flu shot as an intrus on their time becaus it wa clearli obviou that i wa not an import custom to them . after <unk> minut the paperwork wa final given to me and after anoth 10 minut the <unk> final gave me a flu shot . in <unk> , i came into the walgreen at the corner of higley & william field to find no custom in the pharmaci area yet it took the staff 45 minut to administ a flu shot , my recommend is that if you are look for a place to get a flu shot , thi locat is not the one to come to .
came at <unk> on saturday . no greet when enter the store . line 4 peopl deep with machin behind the counter so loud you ca n't hear anyon talk in the shop . surprisingli anoth worker came out to put a cake in the display and went to the back as if the line of peopl at the counter did n't even exist . i 'll tri it again but onli under new manag . the current state of <unk> is a clear failur .
first time tri thi local spot . whi have i not been here befor ? thi is right around the corner from the hous and liter next door to our favorit pizza spot . i wa n't sure what to tri but i knew i want someth cold on thi hot day ... i opt for the <unk> white irish . it is delici ! and <unk> the coffe is is dark roast . my favorit ! it is not too sweet but give you just enough flavor . stay tune ... we may be back tonight to tri the ice cream !
came here to get some pet treat use a buy one get one offer that <unk> had email me . when first enter the store , it smell like dog and dog food . not a good smell in the 100 degre heat of summer . got the treat i want and then there wa an issu with the coupon , but the manag fix the issu in reason time . so , no issu with the custom servic . the store itself just seem outdat , not kept up , and dirti . i think if they would clean it up , it would be a more pleasant shop experi .
extrem unprofession . i would give them 0 star if i could . i wa schedul to get my hair blow dri and style for my babi shower at 11 am on a sunday morn . i show up for my appoint onli to find out that they were close without ani prior notic . there were 3 other guest that had been wait outsid in the snow sinc 10 am . it ha been 4 day sinc my event and i have yet to receiv a call to at least `` tri '' to explain their unprofession . i post a review on their facebook page and they just <unk> their page . do not trust them with style your hair for major life event .

amaz food , servic and set . love it . will definit go back . get a reserv though - it get veri busi on a weekend .
the most welcom and invit store . the owner is passion about the busi and share her expertis and joy with her custom . it 's a beauti space , a thought renov with color yarn on all the wall . in the back there 's rock chair and space to sit and knit and talk . there are some hand knit item for sale and a rack full of suppli and accessori . definit an uniqu store and a welcom addit to <unk> .
best unlimit sushi in the <unk> area ! i 've had unlimit sushi at a lot of differ spot in charlott , but mr. tokyo ha been he best so far . it 's a great valu for the lunch menu , onli $ 12 ! the dinner menu ha much more varieti though . a huge choic of app also ! thi is my favorit sushi spot around .
i would have thought that a place call `` beer bistro '' would be right up in my <unk> . i enjoy vari type of beer and love eat <unk> food . what 's not to love ? and truli enough , the place ha grown from fairli humbl begin . <unk> iron and contemporari stool and tabl <unk> . the staff are friendli and attent , wheel around the space arm with an understand of the <unk> creat <unk> menu ( did we realli let the word `` <unk> '' <unk> into our <unk> ? serious ? <unk> . i do n't like <unk> ) . they are well awar of the pair of food and beer that will make a good meal , and will also allow you to get a sampler of beer without resort <unk> on one pint . good point all around . that 's the good stuff . the sens though is that thi is a place to boast about the <unk> of your expens account . as vari and numer as the beer are , they are not cheap . mostli thi is due to them maintain the abil to provid a rang of offer . but you can also add on an extra 10-15 % onto the bottl and tap price base on the number of credit card with compani name punch into them that come forth for payment . the food is tasti but can sometim come off a bit pretenti for a place that ha someth as fun as beer as one of the ingredi . all in all it 's a fine place to go , but make sure someon els is pay for it .
simpli the best ! no disappoint here ! will to share inform about my car to help me keep it for year . i will be back !

the hotel is great even if smell in the casino area is quit bad with all the smoke ... .. but we love <unk> hotel especi for <unk> the ladi at the concierg ... she wa amaz to support us on all activ we had plan to do .
i realli wish i could review their food , but i ca n't becaus they <unk> ran out in half an hour . although they onli had enough food to give the custom that arriv in the first half hour their order , they continu take order for anoth 30 or 40 minut . then they announc that they were no longer take order and had run out of food . so we thought `` wow that wa close ! '' nope ... 20 minut later they told us they did n't have enough food for us either even though we had alreadi order ( along with 15 other peopl ) . on top of all that the attend apolog a littl bit for what it happen , but eventu got an attitud as custom got frustrat and eventu said `` i do n't need thi ! '' neither do we , sir ; we need taco . veri disappoint sinc i heard the food wa good , but the busi is veri poorli manag . if i could somehow give them a neg one star review i would for the hour of my life they took . <unk> : i write thi from the drive-through at wendi 's , becaus they do n't run out of food .

coffe rush is by far the best coffe shop experi the east valley ha to offer . it 's a great place to studi or just hang out with friend . as far as the free wi-fi with drink . i am in full support . the place ha to make a busi somehow and i think that 3 hr is adequ . what the barista lack in custom servic they make up in qualiti and expertis . their drink are alway perfect and they will mix up ani drink imagin . take that starbuck ! the place is almost alway busi with custom in line so they must be do someth right . my onli request ? take over the shop next door and expand to a similar size like the gilbert <unk> . locat .
tip - do n't use the `` check-in <unk> '' of a free ice cream cone with your frozen yogurt . they have <unk> it and all ice cream cone are free now . well , by `` free '' , i mean that you have to pay for the ice cream cone by weight , which is how these place make money . as far as the review ... . meh ... .it wa ok. a lot of the top look like they had been out all day and had n't been clean up . it wa ok overal . i 've been to a lot of nicer place with frozen yogurt . i wo n't be go back .

overpr . decent food . <unk> . not worth the premium dollar . the shrimp appet is excel . been twice , <unk> for the cost . better valu elsewher .
servic is aw . beer wa warm , we ask for cold beer and did not drink the warm one but they left them at the tabl and of cours charg show up on the bill . wing were super larg and unpleas . no cutleri or napkin serv befor or after we receiv the meal and we had to ask for them . veri bad experi .
excel custom servic . veri thorough clean . it take a littl longer than your typic car wash but the result is worth it . thi is the <unk> my car ha been sinc it left the dealership ! will definit come back ! ! !
even though i live around the block i 'm never come back here . went in to grab one of those overpr cold press juic they have . i buy it on debit and leav . i shake the bottl and all these <unk> <unk> appear ; i keep shake and they do n't disappear . <unk> date is two day ago . appar pull <unk> <unk> from the fridg is not a prioriti here . upon return , the staff : a . do n't know how to refund debit purchas at first and spend a few minut text for help . b . eventu attempt to refund me the charg amount and not my 15 % tip ( i 'll never again tip for a bottl beverag purchas ever at a cafe again ) . <unk> veri like did n't refund me correctli sinc the refund amount ha n't appear on my bank statement . edit : hour later and no refund , which mean they 100 % straight up took my money for free . so go to tokyo smoke if you want to have to inspect <unk> date with zero confid that anyon here give a crap either way , or onli bring cash know <unk> get a debit refund wo n't happen , and also if you 've been die to spend <unk> dollar and receiv precis <unk> in return for it !
thi place wa better than i <unk> $ 20 cover for guy wasnt bad for a saturday night . at first the crowd wa a littl older but i guess they had slot machin to hit later in the night . wa expect to blow alot of money here but did n't realli have to after order 2 <unk> and a coupl of shot music wa kinda wack until later in the night ( refer to older crowd abov ) ... cool view of the strip and good atmospher ... had lot of fun
they get the order right mayb 1 out of 3 time . i ca n't stand pickl , and no matter how mani time i say no pickl , it 's as if that mean `` extra pickl . '' the mediocr staff will soon be replac by comput , i can not wait . good for the machin , they will do a much better job .
i know enough about french cuisin and the mani region and prepar method ( classic french vs , countri french ) , which is whi i can say that for a buffet , thi place is good . ye the line wa long but just the dessert are worth it . i wa most impress with the <unk> ( <unk> region ) select , well they did tast like <unk> <unk> food . but the red sauerkraut ( cabbag ) they use wa just right for me . the saute <unk> onion fill the air with a delight <unk> . for $ <unk> thi wa a good <unk> of french cuisin . final , the dessert and appl pie are just phenomen .

thi is probabl one of the worst mexican experi i 've had thu far . i hate to say it but i will most like never come back . i order a steak burrito and it tast like dog food . my friend order soft taco and they were not a fan of their meal either . by the look of other review thi place is suppos to be amaz . i would like to give it anoth shot but i felt sick to my stomach walk out of there after eat and that 's say a lot becaus i love all type of food . the onli reason thi is get 2 star is becaus the chip and salsa bar wa bomb ! ! !
veri nice brunch servic . we were treat veri well and actual were given a privat littl tabl area as request but wa unexpect . everyth wa fabul and the food wa veri good . tini plate for the hot dish but you can order more than one if you want more . go hungri and enjoy ! thi wa a first time , not out last , and we walk around the ground a bit and check out the spa and got a tour by jen who wa awesom and veri friendli ! just a fun day !

i have enjoy bring my <unk> to dr. <unk> . the staff is friendli and they have appoint that are conveni ( <unk> ) which both add up my satisfact . not expens compar to other vet in the area .
thi place is slow beyond <unk> . how do they stay in busi ? i wait 15 min for my order which wa wrong and cold . i got the excus `` were short staf '' . there were two car in line and no one in the dine area . how much staff do you need for two custom ? i think they laugh about how bad they are as worker . becaus they could care less ... .
i 'm a big <unk> lover and i 've tri sever differ place but i wa n't too impress with the way they prepar the food here . i order the filet and shrimp and the shrimp wa like <unk> . it tast like it wa n't cook all the way and it wa veri disappoint . the filet wa good but i 've definit had better from other place . they offer chicken fri rice for <unk> extra and our chef drown it in soy sauc so it almost look like soup when he put it in the bowl . everyon love chicken fire rice and he just ruin it ! the best part is when they toss the shrimp to see if you can catch it in your mouth . if your lucki enough you may get a shot and they give you free sake . i have n't tri the <unk> steak yet , it is super expens unless you are out for a special occas . a lot of other review seem to like the sushi . i guess i 'll have to miss out becaus i wo n't be come back . i 'll just keep go back to <unk> 's ! they never disappoint .

chines fast food place tend to be the same in term of qualiti , so what make or break them is servic . the staff that work here are amaz to be around with friendli smile and wonder servic . would eat here again !
i struggl with thi rate . we were told that we could sit at the bar if we want to sit soon and be that we had <unk> ticket in 80 minut and hunger right then and there , we chose the bar . we were told it would be the same menu . we are seat in what would be a veri nice booth anywher els but here they refer to it as sit at the bar <unk> it not at the main restaur . we are given the cafe menu . i ask for the tast menu and the waiter goe into thi whole long song and danc about how there are two differ menu and two differ chef and hi chef will say no . at thi tabl with me is a waitress at anoth 4 star vega restaur who total join me in make fun of thi fool who just <unk> told us we cant spend $ 100 a person here becaus we are seat on the other side of a <unk> and we can onli spend a total of $ 100 for 3 peopl . thi weird waiter must work for some other reason then tip . in the end howev , the food won out . the `` liquid therapi '' menu hit the right spot with a `` <unk> '' but not so much with the mango martini . the bread serv in a bag with some of the <unk> butter wa simpli heaven . the dish were serv with excel present . as they were laid out on the tabl , <unk> waiter return with <unk> ask how everyth is . um , buddi no one ha tast anyth yet . he come back 5 minut later to ask again while we are all <unk> . when we could talk we report it good . my experi with 3 or 4 chees ravioli in a cream sauc is that the chees are <unk> . here howev , the chees each came aliv with each bite . the sauc and the roast <unk> nut and chop <unk> tomato were a perfect blend . the pesto cream sauc need to be finish , everi last drop from your plate with the good bread . it 's too good to leav a drop ! the <unk> wa light as air and the chicken <unk> wa also mix to combin but not overpow the natur tast , so i wa told . so it could have been the waiter that mar the experi but all in all , i would say it wa veri good but not as amaz as it san francisco companion .

thi is my favorit coffe shop . it 's the best i 've found out here in az . it 's also the onli place i 've found to get caffein past <unk> out here in the glendal area . even if it wa n't though , i 'd still drive the 20 minut to it . not even just to studi , although the tini shop is well suit for it . the owner is a wonder woman and her worker have all been veri well suit to the place . the ambianc is <unk> but not <unk> . what els should i mention ... <unk> know there 's someth i 'm forget ... .. oh yeah . coffe . each cup , even of their basic coffe , is individu brew . dark as midnight and strong as ... <unk> that are realli strong . it 's wonder . the best coffe i think i 've yet found in a region that doe n't seem to like strong coffe . it 's okay , i know where a shot of <unk> is if i want real coffe , not some <unk> sweet dairi beverag that onc pass by someon <unk> who had drank coffe a week ago . realli real coffe . it 's here .

thi place is serious rate as a top vegetarian eateri ? in that case i could just as easili set a <unk> box up on the strip and hand out <unk> factori made patti on <unk> bread with no condiment and get the same award . becaus that is what you are pay 8 $ and up for . factori . made . shit . not even season factori patti , oh no . for you meat eater let me break it down for you , factori made vegan/vegetarian patti are the equival of the hamburg patti you get at mickey d 's and burger king . at least there they know it 's cheap crap , and you get the price for it . here , they charg you a ridicul price for stuff you can go to ani store now day and buy yourself , make yourself , and it would be better and cheaper for you . my friend brought me here , bless her soul , becaus she want to tri the highli <unk> veggi food , sinc she is convert to the green side . so here is the meal we got after half an hour of wait ( where mind you other who arriv after us were serv <unk> befor us ) : i got the grill chicken burger , vegan style , which consist of the vegan patti ( a veri thin , small patti not big enough for the enorm bun they throw it on ) with mostli iceberg lettuc and one sliver of tomato , plu <unk> out <unk> chees shred and the most <unk> fri i 've ever had . they claim that the fri were bake , but most of them were cook just enough to not be raw , but were so soft that it wa basic a <unk> of <unk> potato . oili too . she got the panini sandwich , which wa the same thing , just differ bread . and bake chip . lay bake potato chip . wtf ! ? thi place claim it 's organ and healthi , but they serv lay chip here ! ? that shit is so process they legal should not be allow to put <unk> ' on the bag ! the onli logic reason for thi place to have the reput it doe in the vegan/vegetarian world is becaus they have no real competit . and the locat is in an area where peopl are too rich and lazi to make their own meal , so they go here and feel better about themselv .
thi is not guitar center , or sam <unk> . thi is a real genuin mom & pop famili busi . a major of the custom are actual work musician . <unk> is the queen of <unk> repair , for the western unit state . he husband chuck is also a veri experienc top notch electron repair man . i do n't think veri mani other <unk> tech use a <unk> <unk> to match <unk> . yeah , thi store is small and funki . some day they have some great deal . they are one of the few if not onli store that got into the <unk> market for <unk> music , sell <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other instrument associ with <unk> <unk> & <unk> <unk> . thi store is get close to 95 year old , and still in the same famili . if i need someth small , or just want to drop in , thi is a great place . they also have a <unk> meet everi month that is realli special , and neat . i am manag a build in anoth citi that wa home to `` an institut '' . close it , hurt , and it make place like <unk> 's all the more special . how mani 75 year old peopl will say , `` oh yeah , i bought a <unk> from guitar center back in <unk> '' ? none ! that is what you get with a place like <unk> . you get a <unk> , and 3 or 4 gener of real experi in music instrument sale , & repair . what do you get at guitar center ? some kid that repeat opinion like a <unk> , or a know it all jerk intent on sell you some overpr piec of <unk> ? <unk> & chuck are two of the <unk> peopl on the planet ! the guy with all the tattoo is okay too . drop in , say hi , buy a littl someth , or not , just be sure and come back again .
i can not rave about thi place enough . i stumbl upon it by accid after play <unk> at the bellagio when i wa head back to valet . sat myself at the bar and began <unk> on the <unk> and bread which wa excel . i recommend the oliv burger with the truffl fri . both were outstand and cook just right . for dessert ( and i onli have dessert if i 've enjoy the entre ) i had the chocol peanut which wa veri good . i would certainli return to oliv becaus the servic abov all wa outstand .
best place for montreal smoke meat sandwich . the sandwich are pack with a heap load of meat with yellow mustard on white bread . with a side of fri and a pickl , it the go to place after hit ripper in montreal .

bellagio ha it own charm , there is no doubt about it and the locat in the middl of the strip , make it even more attract for your vega stay . it is beauti decor dure the holiday . thi wa our second stay at bellagio and we opt for the strip view room at the spa tower . dure our first stay , we stay at the fountain view room at the main tower . first visit <unk> we love the view from the room and we enjoy watch the fountain from the room . howev , we did n't like the 2 hour long wait for check-in . we use a third parti websit to do the book ( did n't repeat the same mistak for our second visit ) . also , we book fountain view non-smok room but we were given smoke room ( i know ! ! ! ) . and we were told they are no fountain view room avail that are non-smok . wait , did n't we pay for that . we were told that the non-smok room will be clean to perfect and we wo n't get the smell . <unk> it wa realli bad , we could n't even stay insid the room . then we left the room at 11pm in the night so that the filter in the room can be chang . we had book for two room and same problem in both . pleas do n't allow peopl to book non-smok room if you are not go to have them avail when they come to check-in ! ! ! ridicul . so , pleas call and confirm that they have the room avail and they will be abl to keep them readi when you get there . also , do n't expect thi to be a 5 star experi , we have gone to other 5 star hotel and the experi here is noth similar . if you want to enjoy the fountain view and not worri about the 5 star servic , go to thi place or els take your busi elsewher as frankli no one here care . they have enough demand that the check-in lobbi doe n't even have place for your <unk> parent to sit as it is full of visitor who are roam around . serious the worst check-in experi we ever had . second visit - <unk> my parent were visit us from <unk> and we thought they should be abl to stay in the middl of the strip and enjoy the view of the fountain if they are not abl to go around as much . we thought thi time around we will have a better experi . check in - we were abl to do mobil check-in as we did our book through their websit thi time . again , onli one room wa avail at 3 pm and the other room wa not avail until 4:30 <unk> in the world have you ever been told that both your room are not readi by 3pm as we can not alway meet the check-in time . we call in the morn to make sure one of the room is two queen and not one king . we were told sure that request can be accommod . but guess what , we got the room late and even then it wa not two queen just one king . they did n't have one avail with two queen like earlier they did n't have a non-smok room ( haha ! ) . we again go down run to the check-in counter ( trust me go from your room to the check-in counter is a long walk ! ! ! ) to talk to them and were told they can give us a <unk> bed and that 's the best they can do . we were travel with famili and did n't want to deal with thi , so we just agre to whatev . but pleas be sure that thi is not like ani other 5 star hotel where custom servic is prioriti , here the staff is tri realli hard to get by . oh and the <unk> doe n't end here . on the next day of our stay , we went out after lunch and return after 5 hour to find one of the room not even clean . i did n't have the energi to call them and argu about it but i did leav a note to the clean person . <unk> , that 's the servic you can expect . so , am i go to come back to thi place for it fountain - i do n't think it 's worth the horribl check-in experi , the long walk to the room and dirti room after pay a <unk> price for the room . oh , i forgot to mention , we had dine credit for the room which we had to call and get fix when it wa not automat taken care of . <unk> , pleas make sure your bill are fine and you are get the room you book and paid the price for . hope other have better experi to share !
we have had noth but troubl with thi compani . the instal wa sloppi and they <unk> the tile on the ground dure instal . they also left low of a mess than i expect . upon the first use of the grill , the knob got so hot that i got a <unk> on my hand when i went to adjust the temperatur . the <unk> temperatur of the grill onli show <unk> degre at the time . they ship me a bar to instal along the back . it wa simpl and summer to work , but when i spent over $ <unk> for the grill and island , whi wa thi not alreadi instal ? the next time i use it , i left the grill on to cook off the sauc on the grate . i left it on high for about 25 minut , though i had onli meant to do so for a much shorter time . the temperatur wa <unk> off the <unk> . the grill and tile nearbi are damag . i 've never had a similar issu with a <unk> grill ( thi one wa convert to natur ga ) . final , part of the purchas agreement wa to instal a ceil fan . they did not do thi at first , becaus they forgot . when the other team came out for the instal they did a sloppi job here , too . thi allow water into the van , destroy it . they origin said they 'd replac it , if onli we had purchas an <unk> fan . when we told them that thi wa an <unk> fan , suddenli they said no to anyth and they are now take long time to respond . i could not be more disappoint in a compani . if i enter find myself in the <unk> for a grill again , i 'd never do busi with them .

the men 's restroom ha been repair
after write my review , i start to get curiou about just how tini thi station 's playlist actual wa . i want to know it wa n't just me , but that the small size of the station 's track that get play over & over again wa actual a verifi fact & not just a matter of <unk> on my part . so i start actual research & track the song that they <unk> ( i work for a market research firm for 10+ year so i tend to be a bit of a <unk> <unk> ! ) thank , their websit keep a record of their playlist to save me from have to actual be tune in <unk> - i 'm sure have to listen to all that <unk> would have driven me bat crazi ! i would onli tune in occasion just to <unk> that what wa be post on the websit wa <unk> with what wa actual play and inde found it to be 100 % accur each time i listen . my find will make you cri . first and <unk> , there is veri littl varieti in the artist that get airplay . there are onli about 100 band that thi station play . for ani radio station , that 's rather pathet - but for someon claim to be an altern station , thi is <unk> ! more than most other format , altern artist are plenti especi consid all the variou type & <unk> & <unk> they could be draw from . i 'll return to the <unk> of artist play in a moment but now let 's move on to the number of actual song thi station play ... there are onli between <unk> song in their entir playlist . now bear in mind , radio is a 24/7 <unk> & thi is a <unk> <unk> number of song for a station to have . especi consid how there 's onli around 100 artist they play . <unk> of those few artist they play have four or more song in the playlist and three have ten or more song play with the most be red hot chili pepper with 14 song in rotat . not onli will you hear the same small pool of song play over & over but they seem to be pick by robot rather than given ani consciou thought by someon who know what they 're do - the same song or artist often get repeat veri close to their last spin . <unk> yet ? well , hold on to your hat , be sit down ... and mayb just to be on the safe side you may want to have a box of <unk> or someth <unk> you can throw up in as you read thi next part . so , as mention out of the vast rich <unk> of altern musician that alt az could be play , onli about 100 are actual find their way onto the station . the lack of varieti and artist they play is by far the station 's biggest weak . so with the minim number of peopl you 'll hear when you tune in , whi whi whi are they give airplay to peopl like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and taylor swift ? serious ? um , do the peopl run thi station even grasp the concept of altern music ? these are act that altern music is an `` altern '' to ! so thi station - have the <unk> to call itself `` arizona 's altern '' - not onli play <unk> few altern artist , but wast the <unk> number of it slot on <unk> that are the veri <unk> of altern ! <unk> and swift get airplay but artist like system of a down , talk head , <unk> , <unk> , nation , <unk> , <unk> , cure , arcad fire , smith , <unk> , & tear for fear are <unk> to be found ? thi station doe n't even play ani <unk> <unk> ... an alt station without <unk> is like a roast beef sandwich with no roast beef ! hey alt az , `` where 's the beef ? ! '' wait . it get wors . i tri contact the station directli with my concern & their respons wa complet <unk> . the # 1 rule of busi is `` know your custom '' . here i am , a member of your target audienc practic hand over the key to the <unk> of how to be not just good but <unk> & they have their finger in their ear . if thi wa a station with ani degre of excel , i would be the most <unk> listen ! but they 're not onli fail to give me a reason to tune in but actual give me sever reason to seek music elsewher ! <unk> ! it doe n't matter if you 're a radio station , an eateri , or a mattress maker - if you have no desir or interest in give your custom base what they want , you are dead on arriv & right now alt az <unk> is a <unk> . valley fan of good alt radio have been in <unk> sinc the <unk> of <unk> . just befor thi station came along , two ( or three depend how you consid them ) differ <unk> were work on <unk> the <unk> brand and <unk> . both gave up when alt az came along sinc they promis to be a major altern station on one of the valley 's <unk> <unk> . yet listen to thi station for ani length of time is like a big `` i 've wait age for a good alt station & all i got wa thi <unk> <unk> '' <unk> . alt az is a total <unk> in the face to those who 've wait patient for a decent alt station . we need a <unk> ... but right now <unk> is the one who 's <unk> !
went back after not go for a while becaus we were disappoint last time , but thi time we were highli satisfi ! ! new sushi chef wa amaz ! all our favorit roll were just as good if not better then they use to be ! <unk> roll is our all time favorit ! all the staff wa friendli !
we came in 15 min befor close , and the asian ladi work look up with that , i ca n't wait to go home look . <unk> , she wa n't rude nor <unk> . i ca n't say she wa all that welcom either . but oh well , i get . i promis the kid ice cream all day and i had a my tea crave . come from a day outdoor and be at the <unk> who live nearbi ... <unk> the perfect time to stop in . so that 's what we did . i love the vast amount of homemad ice cream flavor be offer . also , they even have a good amount of vegan flavor as well . wonder ! might sound <unk> to those who have read my other review , but ... i live in a home of allergi central . howev , their vegan ice cream is made with almond milk so if you have a nut and dairi allergi ... well , either bust out the <unk> or <unk> it and opt for <unk> flavor appeal to you . lol . the <unk> order a vegan chocol , regular nutella banana ( i know ) , and regular vanilla ice cream for $ 2.75 each . good <unk> , but it 's homemad . what the hey , right ? i 'm not sure if a cone is an option as she automat scoop them into a cup . she ask if i need a <unk> for the ice cream which i thought is a good option for those who some reason need it . guess what i order ? ! ? ! ? wild guess ? ! ? ! ? i 'm such an excit person that i order a strawberri ... green tea ! <unk> lol . i wa tri to be excit by skip the black tea for the night and go green . skip the boba . i had a boba hut <unk> becaus i should of gotten boba even though it is n't my fave thing to have . the husband had the <unk> milk tea with the sea salt and boba . <unk> milk tea is equival to a brown sugar milk tea . but wait ... <unk> better ! ! ! okay , look ... i do n't order milk tea . have i had milk tea ? sure have . but i 'll tell you thi , thi ha got to be <unk> <unk> milk tea i have ever had . that is a huge statement . i would drive from the north side all the way to thi joint for an <unk> milk tea , but you have to add the sea salt becaus it 's the onli way i know it and it is delici . the drink tast creami . that 's the best way i can put it . the sweet wa on point . i complet forgot about my drink and want to inhal the husband 's order . it wa so good . oh , well ... as for my drink . still think tea time ha the best strawberri base . green tea is definit a power flavor especi if they 're use like a <unk> green tea . there wa noth strawberri about my drink , but certainli green <unk> . would i return ? ye ! all of a sudden a trip to the <unk> ha it <unk> . lol . they have a menu i 'd lie to stare and explor more . did n't get to do that becaus the kid were overli excit like a 9 year old girl would be if she saw justin <unk> ... <unk> the 11 year old <unk> . i would highli recommend give it a shot if you need a cold treat to cool down especi dure summer or are in the mood for a boba . definit kid friendli ! skip the part where you <unk> the stroller and just bring the babi carrier in . but if you must and it is n't a busi day , a stroller can definit make it way in there . enjoy !

thi ha been my go to hakka place for a decad now . i do prefer <unk> for certain dish but i have a loyalti to china cottag that i ca n't break . the lunch special here are great for <unk> $ lot of option includ vegetarian . the dri chilli chicken and chicken <unk> ha alway been a favourit . the place is much nicer ever sinc they had to renov after the fire in the plaza . if you 're in the area do drop by for some hakka good
thi wa my last taco place and again it wa mainli becaus of the review and again , they were wrong . first , i did onli tri their taco and onli 3 kind , i can not review the whole restaur , but i figur these are basic food so if it is a good restaur , they would get it right . again i had the carn asada , carnita , and <unk> pork . they actual onli use 1 thick tortilla soft shell instead of the two , made it a littl <unk> , differ textur , i have had these befor and like befor , i felt they were <unk> to the two thin tortilla . the meat i could not tast becaus they were cover up in their sauc . i do n't know if thi wa the <unk> , i definit did not ask for it . anyway , when you smother someth with sauc , everyth usual come out tast the same . so they all tast similar and <unk> . i gave it a two star instead of a one wa for the servic , veri fast , food tast like it too and two the price were a littl less than the other place . so i think for now i will stick to <unk> grill in chandler becaus it seem like the best around the area . phoenix is anoth quest , too far though , mayb some time later .
best dentist ever ! i have been go to dentist for almost 50 year and be <unk> with bad teeth and good dental insur i have had extens work done over the year . i wa at an appoint today to have some work done and it wa total painless . when i mean painless i meat noth , <unk> , zip . i did n't even feel the <unk> needl go in , not even the initi <unk> team is veri profession and they have the latest equip , if you are look for a new dentist i would hurri becaus thi new practic is go to fill up veri quickli .

my husband and i had dinner here last night . we have rel that live in la vega and have want to tri thi place for a while . the food wa excel - by far the best thai food i have ever had in the <unk> , europ , or asia . ( that said , while i have travel in asia - i have not been to <unk> . ) in addit to great food - the wine select wa amaz . the wine list is veri extens and can be veri expens , but there are some bottl in the $ <unk> rang . ( in other word , you can get a special bottl of wine , but you can also just buy a good bottl too . i ca n't wait to eat here again ! we definit plan to go back befor we head home to <unk> in a few day ! ( mayb tonight ? or tomorrow ? )
we live in the area and had not been to the restaur in a while . we had <unk> of soup ( $ <unk> ) , 1/2 lb . burger ( 8.50 ) , and a <unk> ( $ <unk> ) . the <unk> wa to have an aioli on the bread per the menu . there wa an <unk> smear of the aioli . when i ask <unk> for more inform her the sandwich wa dri , i wa inform there would be an upcharg for the aioli of $ .50 . she deliv the aioli and there wa mayb a <unk> of aioli in the <unk> . she said she would tell the chef about the issu . while we can afford $ .50 , you think they would have want a satisfi custom especi sinc the menu say the aioli is on the item and it wa not . we most like will not return . if they have to pinch penni like thi , we will spend our money elsewher .
came in & sat at the bar again for dinner . bartend are help when you can get their attent . i think if i wa on display ( behind a bar ) as they are ... i would be more <unk> about discuss the tip i get , what i did last night ( : o ) etc ... my pasta dish wa realli spectacular though ! it wa the lobster & shrimp ravioli with crab <unk> . veri well stuf ravioli , cook perfectli ! the crab <unk> wa some yummi dark green dress with a light <unk> & plenti of yummi chunk of <unk> . the tomato sauc realli wa the best though ... veri bright , creami with a slight smoki sweet . chunk of stew tomato throughout ( but not stew down to mush ) . i 'd definit recommend thi dish .
as my favorit place in harbor front were all pack , it wa a good chanc to tri thi place . the food is pretti good , the price is decent for the area . the patio on the side is in the shade which is good dure the summer . the servic is ok . noth to complain at thi first visit . i will definit come back .

took my car to them for some front end work when i <unk> on snow into a <unk> . actual would have been happi with them if they had done the job right but ultim they did n't and did not stand behind the part they put in my car . said the part onli had a one year guarante and by the time i go time to see them it wa a few month over . first of all who order part with a one year guarante when the standard from the dealer is lifetim . said they would have to charg me for a new part and instal even though it wa onli about 14 month old . realli ? whi would i have them do thi again when they could n't do it right the first time ? eventu need some other work and took it to the dealer . had them look and listen to the part make nois . they replac the part and told me it look to them like it had never been chang to begin with as what they pull out wa origin to the car . now i know whi they would n't stand behind their work . my advic is ani part they say they replac ask for the old part back which they did not do for me . by the way the dealer fix it right and it ha not been an issu sinc .
hand down the best agenc in <unk> . i know that 's a big claim but be that i am sign up with more than half the agenc 's out here , i have yet to find a better agenc . the ladi 's in the front take their time to get to know you , know your background and your limit . not onli do they find you a job with your experi they also give you an opportun to tri new compani 's and get new experi .
escap room are all differ . i 've been to a few . what i like about thi place is they are the onli one who actual explain how to open a lock . so mani time we have been stuck in the game becaus even though we had the combin of the lock , we did n't know how to actual open it and we were n't reset it properli . here , they actual told us what lock are there and how to <unk> it . thi wa super help ! as for the actual room itself , we got the cop and <unk> and it wa pretti fun . it wa differ all the time . it even involv memor and other thing we had to do to get out . all the other one i 've been to are just lock and puzzl , thi one had way more varieti of thing to actual do . i highli recommend thi place .
i have been to see dr. <unk> mani time for the past 2 year and i have alway found him and hi staff to be veri concern and care for my well be . i could never see myself go to anyon els and have grown to truli trust and respect hi opinion over time .
how doe thi place onli have like a half dozen review ? as a sicilian , if i want italian , i cook it . when my realtor insist i tri thi place , i thought , `` well i am hungri , and the fridg is empti ... '' and so off went the boyfriend and <unk> <unk> , the owner , wa there . he <unk> us immedi and want to know our stori . appar thi is a place for regular . we fit right in . thi guy is the man . he wa so nice , and so welcom , as wa hi larg and loud italian famili that were dine there that night . hey , these are my peopl . we love to eat , we love to talk , and we love our wine and dessert . <unk> ha it all ; atmospher , food , famili , and a full bar . the employe are good peopl . the bartend know their stuff . i suspect close to everyth is homemad down to the <unk> in the salad ( and if not it tast the part ) and the dessert are too ( not there , they order them local , which is also awesom ! ) i would never have found thi place . it look like noth special from the outsid , and noth too fanci on the insid either , but who care ? it 's delici , and i love come here . i have probabl tri everyth on the menu at thi point and that 's not an <unk> . everyth is good , simpl , and perfectli done . it 's exactli what italian should be . authent with huge portion . suck it oliv garden , i never like you anyway . serious , check thi place <unk> it 's a gem . <unk> is key in good italian cook and they nail it . the veal is perfect everi time , the zucchini mountain is spot on , and all the pasta dish are great . tri the sicilian dinner too ; if you know the differ between sicilian and italian , you will definit appreci them .
the <unk> steakhous is alway pretti solid for food even though it 's a chain . i find it to be pretti consist across their variou restaur . the servic staff at thi particular <unk> wa great . i ate at the bar and found the staff to be veri attent and friendli .
best pizza ever ! serious thi is homemad fresh authent pizza ! these are hand toss , fresh ingredi and cook to order hot ! ye it is in the <unk> but the park lot is well lit , it ha secur and there is a huge <unk> next door that is alway busi so i feel complet safe in and out of here . <unk> take realli good care of hi custom . i love the person pizza deal , right size even for a guy , but i can share thi with someon easili and the price is veri competit . i have never tri the deliveri servic i alway pick up . my order is alway readi when promis . when i want pizza and i am by the strip thi is where i go !
found them from groupon , and so happi i did . they have my eyebrow look awesom . the owner is sweet , and her son is ador . thi is way better option than wax , and they are consist with their work .

stop by arcadia tavern tonight around <unk> pm and it wa pack ... grant , it wa a perfect even to be outsid for an august night in phoenix . the entir patio wa full , the bar area had not an empti seat , and from the look of it , the restaur wa do some decent <unk> as well . jack young wa the <unk> <unk> <unk> ' the place with tune from johnni cash , bob <unk> , <unk> <unk> , jimmi buffet , and more . i 'd alreadi eaten dinner , but <unk> share a bite of hi miso salmon ( with rice and asparagu ) and it wa delici . i 'm write thi updat partial to let it be known that thi is just one of the new menu option along with chicken parm , steak salad , edamam , roast chicken with mash potato , <unk> , chop , and <unk> salad . i guess the feedback made it way to manag ... i am pleas with the new varieti of healthi choic . <unk> , the chef , came out to say hello - or perhap we caught him red hand have a drink at the bar ... either way , it wa nice to see him . i 'll be back on my own sometim soon to order my own miso salmon ... and if not me , you 'll like find <unk> <unk> ' a <unk> at the bar . cheer !
it 's hard to give thi place a decent rate , sinc , as john said , you never want to come here . whi the heck doe <unk> alway come at 11 am , anyway ? i 'd expect them to run after the major of peopl are home from work and/or school . howev , for the purpos of thi review , i am forc myself to consid onli the peopl who actual work at thi locat , not the entir compani . despit my ill will toward the compani in gener , the peopl who work here are pleasant and help . the <unk> who assist me the last time went out of her way to help me , actual ... so , if she 's there , tri to get in <unk> 's line ! it would make sens if it were more central locat , but <unk> speak , it 's a straight shot down <unk> for me .
highli recommend ! great for famili . main entranc requir room key for entri after midnight for safeti reason . the front patio is soooo cute ! you can walk to the outlet . bed is comfi and i love the idea of the <unk> to separ the live room and sleep area if need . ha a fit room , pool and <unk> . breakfast wa pretti <unk> , coffe juic toast waffl maker and breakfast sandwich amongst other item . overal veri happi with my stay . i will book again on my next trip

i wa look for a long term auto detail compani who pride themselv in qualiti custom care and could do the job right the first time . my old auto detail retir and sold hi busi so i need anoth . i found elit mobil detail onlin and decid to give them a chanc . sinc i have sever vehicl , i decid to give them my <unk> as a test to see how well they detail car . i schedul the appoint for 10 am on a friday . i will start with the pro : 1 ) carpet and seat were veri clean despit be dirti . they did a nice job . 2 ) exterior paint look fantast . most of all the surfac scratch were remov with veri littl <unk> <unk> . 3 ) detail were nice . now with the con : 1 ) they were late ! thi is a big part of custom servic for me . they call me a few minut befor my appoint time and said they would be late 45 minut . they arriv at my hous an hour and ten minut late . 2 ) bottom 2 inch of windshield wa left dirti . 3 ) instrument <unk> wa miss 4 ) emerg brake wa miss 5 ) wheel well were not done 6 ) wheel cover were not complet ( 2 out of the 4 had signific <unk> and old dirt ) 7 ) middl section of roof not polish 8 ) the carpet took 2 day in 100 degre plu weather to dri out . 9 ) the insid of the car <unk> like <unk> after the car dri out . 10 ) custom servic is absolut horribl i contact christian , the owner , when hi employe arriv late . he said that they were run late from anoth job and that wa normal . i ask what he could do to keep me happi sinc i wa veri upset that they were more than an hour late . he said he could discount addit servic . discount ! ! i spent mani year in custom servic and one of the first thing a manag should do to <unk> thi situat is offer 1 ) a discount in the origin servic price or 2 ) throw in a free servic , not a discount . i tri to get a discount clean becaus they were late and christian told me absolut not . he simpli offer to either clean the <unk> for free , or the <unk> . i ask about the <unk> compart and he said he would discount the servic but would not do it for free . i clean my <unk> around four time a year and it wa n't even dirti . we went back and forth and christian agre to do my <unk> free of charg . i told him that i wa upset and the reason whi i wa upset . christian did not want to listen and wa veri argument make excus for everi comment i had . i allow the detail to do their job and they did well . howev , after a more detail inspect , i notic the <unk> issu . most of them were not a big deal but the biggest issu and the one i am frustrat about came after the car dri out . the smell wa <unk> and <unk> . i went out and bought an `` <unk> bomb '' which help but the smell ha not complet <unk> . after two day , the small is back . i call christian back and left a voic mail . christian than call back and spoke with my wife . he wa veri argument and said the smell wa becaus the carpet were dirti . what ? are you seriou ? i have had my car detail sever time and i have never smelt thi <unk> smell . he said he could come and fix the smell ... for a price . it wa hi compani fault the car smell and he want to fix the problem by charg me more money to get <unk> of the smell they caus . serious ? my wife wa veri upset becaus he wa not will to fix the issu for free . he want us to pay to fix the issu . i spoke to my previou detail who retir and ask him what he thought wa go on . without hesit he said `` <unk> of the seat '' . he explain the carpet will dri out rel fast but if the seat are <unk> , the surfac of the seat may dri but the pad <unk> will remain wet , caus the smell . i am absolut <unk> that he would charg to fix the smell that wa caus by the carpet clean . if you read through the neg comment about hi busi , you will quickli realiz that christian doe not take respons , he will blame the individu custom . on sever review christian state `` on my compani ( ( ( we guarante our servic ! ! ! ) ( the satisfact with our costum is our top of prioriti ! ! ! '' if it wa your top prioriti , you should fix the issu ( for free ) . if you guarante your servic and you fall short of accomplish those servic , you should fix it . that is simpl .
veri bad experi there all the time . feel not welcom : ( ... food is good , but bad servic <unk> today , i wa stand there wait to be seat for <unk> with my mom and kid . even i said `` hello ? ! '' to waiter . that girl turn and walk away to the kitchen . hello ? leav custom stand there without say anyth ? if your guy not accept ani custom <unk> close your front door , thank you !
thi use to be my go to ayc but it 's been about 3 month sinc come here and i now find myself highli disappoint and dissatisfi . as alway the servic is good . they are <unk> and gear to take order , refil drink , and clear plate . but it 's not the servic that i 'm disappoint with , it 's the qualiti of the food . much of the fish serv here is <unk> and unfortun i wa get slice that rang from fresh look and tast , to old and tasteless . the amount of rice they give with the nigiri is crazi . the rice had a slight mush to it with littl flavor . the worst had to be the <unk> ( smelt <unk> ) and the scallop . the <unk> wa mushi and did n't have ani textur you would expect from fresh fish <unk> . the scallop wa clearli <unk> hour befor and left to sit . it 's up in the air whether i am return or not .
you would assum you get into a clean plane upon board right ? ? ? well appar <unk> 's version of `` clean '' is gold fish crumb on the floor and half eaten bag of cooki in the seat back pocket . so gross !
a must to do if your in the area . you get a great view of the river and downtown . plu it 's a great place for a pic and the histori of the area is veri interest . there are mani place to shop , eat and drink in walk distanc .
thi is my first time here , so i 'm not against give thi place a second tri , eventu . but for my first time , the servic ha been horribl . we have wait a littl over 30 minut to order which is just too long . our waitress wa n't around often , and one one the peopl in our parti ask for a water four ( 4 ) time ! she eventu went to the bar to get her water herself . my friend and i order the macaroni and chees . there is an option of type of chees , and at first i thought my choic is what caus the bland of food , but my friend chose differ chees and her meal wa just as bland . everyon els seem to enjoy their meal . two peopl in our parti got the blacken catfish and they enjoy their meal . in my opinion , the wait staff need to be more attent to their custom and need to be either let us know the food will take longer to cook , or get the order in right away .
i had my vehicl repair here a few week ago regard my a/c . i wa abl to retriev my vehicl back the next day with my a/c work perfect . 3 week later my a/c wa work off and on . i call <unk> they made me an appoint for the next day . my a/c wa repair free of charg . the down side wa it took 2 hour to get my vehicl back . but i 'm back to be happi .

i wa disappoint with <unk> queen , sinc i 've live here , i 've heard peopl gush over thi place . my wife and i final went and wait to be seat around an hour , which is n't a big deal if the food live up to the hype , which it did not . the servic wa poor and the food wa averag at best , i could have gone somewher els and had better with <unk> of the wait time .
walk in and got a great straight <unk> shave from <unk> . two <unk> , two hot towel , great blade , <unk> , anoth towel . great atmospher . i 'll definit be back next time i 'm in vega !

so far i 've like the yoga class and like the gym . it is also close to my hous which is realli nice !
great staff and a huge varieti . not the cheapest place in town but oh well what are you go to do it 's legal for everyon now just found out that they went to 24 hour two month ago i had no idea which is great becaus the other night at four in the morn we went to thi place by the airport so lame and make you wait in the lobbi call you in like a doctor offic horribl experi i will onli now forev to go feed
excel place for brunch or breakfast , veri reason price ! the bu yourself thing can be a hassl if you do n't hear your name call , but if you 're upstair they just yell <unk> ! ! ! the scone are pretti tasti , especi onc smother with jam ! i 'd definit recommend eat here to anyon look for cheap meal and some unusu atmospher .
it refresh to find a neighborhood local own coffe spot over the everyday starbuck brand . each cup is individu ground and brew to your like . veri relax atmospher with sever couch , read area with ton of book , and plenti of board game to sip through your cup of joe . def check it out !
closest starbuck to mount charleston mount charleston may be a <unk> forest up in the cloud that ha a <unk> year old tree , forest , <unk> mountain , spring , cave , ski , and <unk> natur . howev , one thing that mount charleston doe n't have is starbuck 's . in recent time when i drove us 95 to mount charleston , i 'd exit the freeway at durango drive , make a right turn then turn into the <unk> 's plaza after the traffic light . when i visit thi starbuck 's i cross traffic that give the freeway a run for it money . it 's starbuck 's drive thru traffic . from my observ , thi is a consist busi drive thru . under thi busi list , i post a pictur of traffic back up to the end of the strip of store . after <unk> cross the cue of stop car , i pass outsid tabl that are fill up . when i make my way insid thi <unk> cafe , there are usual a few peopl ahead of me . starbuck 's <unk> is run hot at thi locat . just like my coffe . befor escap the citi for the fall <unk> of mount charleston , a coffe with pumpkin spice syrup set the tone of the adventur that i am about to <unk> in up in the mountain abov la vega . in septemb , <unk> <unk> is the brew cook in starbuck 's . from pumpkin spice cooki to pumpkin spice <unk> , the lobbi scream <unk> <unk> . at the point of my journey between my origin point in henderson to my destin in the cloud ; starbuck 's give me a place to relax . in a few minut my feet will be get a lot of use hike . at a comfort tabl or sofa seat , i <unk> savor the tast of pumpkin spice coffe while the caffein enter my blood stream will keep me alert for mani hour in the hike trail . thi public live room is my last chanc to connect with <unk> compliment of free wifi befor my cell phone recept disappear in the forest up in the <unk> . in addit to be the closest starbuck 's to mount charleston , it is near <unk> spring at <unk> lamb , desert <unk> <unk> , and thousand of <unk> in the <unk> corner of la vega . late when i have driven us 95 to mount charleston , the best part of wake up ha been thi farm road starbuck 's coffe in my cup .
food and ambienc were fine , price wa what you would expect , but our waiter wa horribl make neg ( in hi <unk> probabl smart ! ) <unk> remark to make us order more food or drink . real shame .
i need a new anod rod for my water heater and neither low 's nor <unk> had them ( appar they do not even stock them ) . one of the low 's employe recommend thi place which is across the street . san had sever type of anod rod in stock and the employe recommend one to me . the price wa around $ 15 . by the way , that is about half what they are on amazon . i 'm not sure thi place typic sell direct to the public . the employe ask me what plumb compani i work for . when i `` <unk> '' that i wa a <unk> he assign the purchas to plumb compani compani and then i paid cash . no big deal i guess - not plan on return an anod rod ...
while i ca n't stand to wait in line for brunch , they do have an excel <unk> bacon sandwich if you 're inclin to sit-down and eat . but as tasti as it is , i would n't wait more than 15 minut in line for it . you can , howev , skip the line and pick up one of their awesom croissant to <unk> as you go . their croissant are good - light and flaki as they should be . and grab a baguett for later ! the baguett ha a nice chew to it and is best with a simpl smear of butter . both are worth get .
a good time <unk> . love the <unk> sign and red light . atmospher is on the <unk> side , but it never reach the point where i could n't hear the other peopl at my tabl . servic wa friendli . now let 's get down to the food . standout item would have to be the broccoli and chees fondu , pierogi , and her with dill sauc ( which also came with an addict pita bread ) . <unk> wa also hearti and gener portion . <unk> sausag left me slightli underwhelm , or mayb it just got lost in the crowd of other eat . <unk> salad wa fresh and tasti in an <unk> <unk> way but could 've use less dress . cocktail list is <unk> but span a good rang of differ tast . whiskey select , on the other hand , is veri , veri gener . definit would n't mind come back here !
thi wa alway my favorit <unk> place in the citi . it wa just ok today . pita wa onli <unk> fresh and not warm as wa typic . the servic wa aw . wait and wait for our cutleri until my wife got up and grab some . wait and wait for our menu then wait after be serv to order anoth drink . we were so frustrat that we walk up to the cash , paid and left .
the servic wa a bit lack , but then again what do you expect from a restaur insid a casino ? i decid to tri the wing and they live up to the hype i 'd alway heard . the wing were the onli reason thi place did n't get a one- or a <unk> rate .
pretti tasti burger ! ! veri modern look and refresh . sadli it 's kinda small and peopl hover to wait for food , so you might want to bring your food elsewher . howev , i discov that the space at the next door oliv and <unk> <unk> can be share even though you eat at modern burger ! ! ! ! <unk> . anoth tip for travel , the wait is about 15-20 minut dure meal hour . so <unk> your flight time ! ! final , on to the food . i got the breakfast burger - bacon , fri egg , patti , lettuc , tomato and delici mayo like sauc . it wa n't my favorit burger but i would definit tri it again next time . the fri egg wa a littl too cook for my like but it wa n't notic . you can also get extra or tell them to cook your meat a certain way or remov some top . my favorit part of the burger wa the sauc ! ! ! ! the bread wa <unk> kinda soggi . not the worst though . i also got the fri . mmmm not my favorit and i would n't recommend it . fat and soft . and although it might just have been sit out for 10 minut , it wa cold when i got it . : ( overal realli good for airport food standard .
<unk> wa basic a vip <unk> theatr but for less than half the price . the seat <unk> and are so comfort . also , the theatr wa veri clean . i do n't think i 'll be go to <unk> again . thi is probabl the best theatr ever .
one of my rare 5-star rate and we just love go here . it is so much like itali , from decor to layout to servic to food and option that you are certain to enjoy it . be warn so you do n't have a super wait by make a reserv . they have an <unk> system open tabl on yelp ! so all you do is choos time , date and number in your parti . what will come up is what reserv are actual avail around the time you choos . they are veri popular so do n't bitch about a wait if you did not plan ahead . the owner seat you , pull out the chair for your women . i start to and he ask , joke and friendli <unk> , if i wa tri to put him out of a job . i told him no , just did n't want to look like a <unk> <unk> . we got along fine . i do n't think thi is a kid place unless your <unk> are restaur <unk> , abl to draw , play with their charact or other thing and do so <unk> . wander around would neither be appropri or accept . full bar and decent pour and portion . wine list and plenti of by the glass option . special offer along with a set meal option . main menu will have plenti to satisfi you . we split a salad on thi occas and it wa not enough . decent portion for one , but not for two . we both order the rigatoni with short rib and sausag and it wa , <unk> put , `` to die for . '' noth to complain about at all . littl <unk> is becom a toni place for <unk> who are escap the hell of <unk> counti . excel neighborhood are come in and a <unk> <unk> sun citi ( carolina lake ) is close to <unk> retir senior who have the time , money and interest in good restaur , so more are come . mama <unk> 's and <unk> 's are other italian restaur locat in <unk> 's downtown <unk>
i had the chicken fri steak . man , it wa pure delici ! plate are about $ 10 and big serv size . servic is great ; our waitress took care of us . never felt rush even though they were busi . would definit come here again .
liter the best first experi i 've ever had . they were so crowd but they handl it well . the bartend are on top of their game , they kept the place clean , the drink pick up and refil and even the mess pick up all of it in a veri time manner . they are gay friendli which make it to me one of the best bar ever ! . they have karaok 5 day a week , the food is great , the drink are price right . i will definit be go back and possibl plan a parti there . the host of karaok wa awesom ! . love thi place
i ca n't believ how avail they made themselv . came to my move within two hour of my last minut call . you can tell the crew had just come from anoth job . those guy were amaz . they took good care of my belong and i tell you , the pack job they did wa excel . not a singl damag piec . art and <unk> . thank first choic .
thi place wa excel . i live near lake la vega , so it 's a hike for me . i wa up in summerlin see a friend and decid to eat breakfast here . sinc it wa a tradit ny style deli , i of cours had biscuit and gravi . i will say , the cream gravi wa veri good , had chunk of sausag in it . could have use a littl more pepper . the <unk> wa good , but too thick for me . it wa crunchi and had good flavor , but if it were <unk> , it probabl would be the best i have ever had . servic wa great , although i went befor 8 am . so , not even close to 1/2 full . the deli case look awesom , i wish i live closer . given the drive , probabl wo n't come back that often , but we certainli will come back some . it 's worth a half hour drive .
me and a few bud were want to grab a burger so opt to tri twin peak on an earli afternoon . plenti of tv go with good sport action . their hot wing with standard sauc were outstand . i wa surpris that their twin peak burger rock pretti good ; i destroy it and the fri . all said better than averag . next time i 'll be <unk> out more wing ... gordon ramsay 's <unk> & fri were better , but 40 % more ... .
overal : 1. good amount and style of fri <unk> chicken bread and fri well , wa hot and <unk> been sit out . not too much greas either <unk> lemonad wa good on flavor and amount of sugar , but wa a bad <unk> juic ratio , too water down <unk> the bread they give you is strang but good , a bit too <unk> though and not toast enough , even by my standard <unk> the sauc wa good , <unk> need to give <unk> % more for the perfect amount for a 4 piec meal , the sauc tast a bit like sweet black pepper and ranch , i like black pepper and so it wa nice with the fri and chicken , i could see someon who hate pepper not like it tho <unk> their ice tea wa just like regular <unk> but a bit <unk> , <unk> but would pleas most custom <unk> coleslaw is shit and i hate it so mayb it wa good but i just dont like coleslaw <unk> the servic wa good , in between a sit down dine and straight up fast food , they bring your food by name and clear it for you , veri nice touch . the manag seem nice but that vari per store <unk> quick and fresh <unk> strang music and <unk> , <unk> ball + light were a nice touch <unk> good price . <unk> i didnt use the bathroom but i should have to rate that too . damn i should put thi on yelp or googl review fuck 4/5 overal tbh
i seem to frequent here for breakfast the most . tri to eat as healthi as i can , i do like their <unk> menu . i have to test my will power to not eat their delici muffin and bake good , my favorit , probabl the carrot <unk> loaf . also , i like that they have menu item that mani breakfast place do n't have , like <unk> <unk> . i 've read some <unk> review about <unk> 's for lunch and dinner , but i have to say i 'd be up for go there for breakfast anytim .

thi place need more review - i am the fourth . i had a decent meal here while in town for my compani . i might not have stumbl on thi restaur if it had n't been for a cowork who ate here previous . it is basic an old hous near the water ( is that a lake or a river across the street ? ) convert to a restaur . they can host group on the second floor . we ate downstair and it wa pretti dead for a wednesday night dure winter , i sens that they may be busier dure the <unk> month . the overal theme is italian and they have sever varieti from the `` boot '' of europ . they have differ <unk> of red sauc , plu oliv oil treatment , with differ pasta . they offer chicken , veal , seafood and steak . oh and they offer pizza , which we decid to share a pizza ( they are person size ) and then have entre . the server brought a `` free '' appet of small slice bread with melt chees and tomato sauc on it . i do n't know when these were made , but after one bite i wa n't go to spoil my dinner with thi free offer . i had a glass of the hous chianti , which wa quit flavor . howev , the second glass i order with my meal tast quit a bit differ - a bit <unk> . i ask our server - nice - if it wa the same bottl , or even the same wine . i think i <unk> him becaus he <unk> out `` bien <unk> '' ( of cours ) . beyond the margarita pizza , i had a <unk> with <unk> sauc . it realli wa the highlight of the meal . the pasta seem fresh and the server said it wa homemad . i ca n't say i would make thi an out of the way stop , but i do n't recal mani other choic in thi area of the island of montreal . i feel thi place <unk> for someth better .
i decid to tri thi sinc it wa a full servic wash . i told the attend that greet me it wa my first time here . i ask what the price for a wash were sinc they were not post . he said 5 dollar for a wash and immedi tri to sell me a 40 dollar wash . i ask him what els they offer . i settl on a wash , <unk> and clean the interior window . that cost <unk> . dure our entir convers he wa extrem rude . i went insid to wait for my car . at thi point i ask the cashier how much wa the candi . she said veri rude that it wa mark . ( in fact it wa by a small white sticker that you can bare see . it wa way over price , but that i expect ) it took them 25 min to wash , <unk> and clean the window . i wa then told it wa done . i went outsid to look at the car . the first thing i notic wa there wa still bird drop on one of my window . i then look over the whole car . it wa still dirti . i grant you that the car wa clean , but there were mani small dirt spot all over the car . the person that i told about the bird drop did a <unk> job of clean it off . he then ask how he did . i told him it wa onli an ok job . he seem to be <unk> . after i got into the car i also notic that the insid of my window wa also smear and streak . i would have had them <unk> my entir car but by their attitud i wa n't go to trust that someth wa n't go to be done to the car . i will never go back and i will tell everyon i can to avoid thi place like the <unk> . probabl the worst car wash i 've ever been too .
i wa on the west side for busi and thi place wa recommend to me for lunch . i love a good reuben and got the brooklyn . reuben . thi wa a sandwich . plenti of meat and huge . remind me of a good deli <unk> . from back east . the homemad pickl were great . i wish thi place wa closer to where i live i 'd definit go back . if i 'm . ever over that way again i 'll be stop in .

so my boyfriend and i came around 9 <unk> pm , i alway go to the one on central and thoma but i wa in the area so we stop , howev i know it wa somewhat late , but when we receiv our order our burger wa `` crap '' super sloppi made , the bun wa soggi , lettuc all over the place , my bf patti wa n't cook all the way . not a good dinner for us . the custom servic wa like if we did n't exist we were n't acknowledg or anyth . i know it wa somewhat late but we 're pay custom . i expect the same servic as a custom who would go in on the afternoon . by far wors <unk> 's experi i 've came across .
we made contact with rabbi shai from <unk> as we want a rabbi who could <unk> over a same sex wed in la vega where my now husband grew up . we decid rabbi shai would be great for our <unk> after an initi <unk> session . he is a warm , friendli guy with a great sens of humor and wa good at keep us at eas in the lead up to the wed . rabbi shai did a great job on the night . he sing some of the <unk> bless and ha an <unk> voic ! mani of our guest remark on what a great job he did . thank you rabbi shai .
<unk> just did n't stack up . mayb i have high expect -- i see burger and i think big and juici . thi littl burger wa neither . sure , it wa cute and littl and had good top -- cheddar chees , caramel onion and mushroom , but the burger itself left much to be desir . i do n't splurg on burger often -- i 'm talk <unk> -- and while i did n't have to feel too <unk> about the few ounc of beef i consum , i did n't exactli get my burger fix <unk> either . at first glanc , the price seem pretti good . but , if you 're a big guy look for a burger , ( like my husband ) , you 'll probabl walk away disappoint . and at four to seven dollar a pop , more than one can get a littl pricey . the sweet potato fri were good and they came wrap in brown wax paper in a cool littl wire basket . the restaur is <unk> and fun and doe have those floor to ceil glass door that slide back , creat an <unk> restaur perfect for arizona 's weather . might be a good burger place to visit with the girlfriend ! or for a quick snack befor you head out to the bar .
we were lucki enough to get a reserv dure restaur week ! excel ! thank <unk> !
i have been go to the <unk> for probabl 10 year , enjoy both the insid vibe and especi the patio . i have been there twice in the past week , as a matter of fact . the food and wine have alway been solid , not except , but servic ha been great and i love that you can actual have a convers without be drown out by other or loud music . previous , i would have given a 4 star rate but down grade after a disappoint experi tonight . i order a bocconini and proscuitto salad on arugula . arugula is a pretti <unk> green that last for a long time , so i wa surpris that about <unk> of the leav were actual <unk> . i ate the bocconini and proscuitto and then realiz how bad the arugula wa . i point it out to the server who apolog and gave me a small green salad instead . the bill arriv with the full $ 16 price for the origin salad from a new server . i mention to her that i had sent it back and she said that the proscuitto and bocconini were veri expens so she could onli give me 50 % off . it realli is n't about the $ 8 but the principl and the way it wa handl . not a good way to retain loyal clientel !
my jimmi john 's addict is one i hope i never break . we alway get the # 12 ( turkey ) and the # 13 ( veggi ) sandwich and they 've never disappoint ... ever . i do n't know what kind of crack they put in the mayo , but it 's someth awesom , that 's for sure . the bread is outstand and we 've even bought the <unk> a few time and brought it home to put in the freezer . awesom to make garlic bread for pasta dish with ! the servic at everi jj 's is alway great ( bar one experi at the lake <unk> <unk> locat ) - but thi one is particularli friendli ... so even though i have one a littl more conveni to me ... i 'll still go the extra 1/2 mile to my <unk> jj 's <unk> out of 10 .

i recent found termit trail in my garag . i did a review of vendor through yelp and put my inform out for a quot . <unk> logic wa one of the first to repli . they were also the first to come out and give a quot . the owner came out himself , we had a good chat and after i had the quot in hand i mention that i wa go to decid after a coupl more quot . he gave me some advic on what to look for in the other quot ; suck as type of chemic use and length of guarante . good solid advic . the other quot came in and <unk> logic won the bid . they came out within day as plan . they commun often and clearli and did the work as expect . hope , we 'll never have to call again for termit , but if we have ani other issu , they will be the first one we call . strongli recommend .
i wa veri impress with thi compani . they were veri help right from the start with ask me question to find out what servic they offer would work best for me . onc i pick a packag the process start right away . there wa fast commun via email of what the next step were along with a guid to prepar for the <unk> with my resum writer . <unk> d wa my writer and she wa great . she work well with my schedul and also made me feel confid with my work experi . i also ad the <unk> <unk> which look amaz . again , i could n't be happier with thi servic and i am veri confid i will find my next job with my new resum !
thi is a disgust place full of creepi dirti , and drunk peopl and <unk> . it is so obnoxi loud with so mani <unk> in a tight space . there r nake peopl , peopl pretend to be statu that then jump out at u and more insan . it may be good for those who want to be with <unk> or go get drunk but thi hell hole get wors each time i come here . especi at night , avoid thi place . you 'd be look for noth but troubl . the light show is n't even good anyway .
i had a veri neg experi at thi place today . i order a custom salad to go and paid all 16 dollar or so for it . wait a few minut and a salad wa hand to me . thank befor i left i look in the bag . it wa a complet differ salad than what i order . i advis them and they apolog . a few minut later i got my salad . when i return home and start eat the salad , i notic there wa someth that i could not chew . i took it out of my mouth . it wa a black twist tie . so that wa n't good . i did , howev , continu eat until i ran into two separ onion ( which i did not order ) and a slice mushroom ( which i did not order ) . i understand how the latter two could possibl happen . obvious the twist tie is anoth stori . i will not go back to thi place and hope that the next person who find a twist tie in their salad doe n't <unk> it . i 've tri to includ a pictur of the <unk> three tasti item but i ca n't . i will add it to the pictur section for the restaur . <unk> 's will sure be happi to have it there .

thi place ha the best onion ring in la vega ! ! ! they are gigant and i 'd recommend it . one order is enough to be share with two peopl . it is fri to perfect . i also recommend the buffalo wing but get the sauc on the side . it is definit one of the best in vega . it is cook right , the skin is veri crispi which i like .

do n't wast your time or money here . for a restaur with great review i wa veri disappoint . not onli wa the food ( <unk> fish ) tasteless , the servic and ambianc were low grade , not to mention the dirti plate . the <unk> d and the waiter <unk> were both not polit . we should have gone with my first <unk> and gone elsewher !
not impress . servic 0 . food bland ( order the bibimbap in a stone pot ) . would not go back
thi review is realli just mine and my husband 's way of <unk> about our wonder <unk> , thoma <unk> . i had contact the dealership about an onlin list for a durango that we were interest in yesterday morn . while that car wa n't avail anymor , thoma wa dedic in find me a great fit for my need . within minut of talk to him , i wa be email multipl list of vehicl that were not onli what i need size <unk> , but price <unk> as well . thoma had the <unk> we agre on brought to thi locat , and set up a time that work with my hectic schedul to take a look at it - all on the same day ! he even gave us the option to do our credit check onlin befor go in to save us time . the dealership close at <unk> and we show up around 7pm and thoma wa there wait for us with my <unk> pull up front . we took it for our test drive and he wa veri polit and talk with us the entir time and unlik our other test drive , thi one wa n't an awkward <unk> the entir time . when we were done he had all of our paperwork readi to go and the price we were look for . he stay with us until everyth wa said and done - which wa around <unk> , and explain everi detail of my new car to me . thoma is an incred <unk> and put everi one of my need first and found me an incred car that will suit my famili 's need for year to come . if you 're consid shop at thi dealership , i would highli recommend ask for thoma ; you wo n't be disappoint ! <unk> also want to give a huge thank you to <unk> for stay late and help figur out all of our <unk> option .
tip : ani seat would be ok in thi small venu ... the show is amaz ! funni . fun to watch . make you wan na get up and danc .
first time at a <unk> mike and i 'm pretti impress at how quickli i wa in and out of the store with multipl order . i order the club sandwich and it wa veri good . the custom servic wa great . i will definit be back when i 'm in the area again . unfortun there is n't one by where i live .
went there a coupl of month ago . the food wa ok but the place wa not great . for starter it 's way too small . i wa seat with a <unk> at my back and wa not comfort . add to that realli loud peopl on a tabl get drunk while their kid are on the next tabl . plu it wa realli hot . the fish and chip i had wa ok but no more . consid that the black <unk> is at coupl of door down , that food is a littl bit better , the servic is more friendli and the environ is a lot better .
they make some of the best burger in pittsburgh ! they have great potato also ! the servic wa good with a friendli staff . i also had a steak salad there onc which wa realli good a lot of steak on it with potato !
had a veri bad experi with the care after surgeri . side issu were identifi to the staff but noth wa done . after <unk> , had to see anoth doctor to take care of one issu and an emerg room trip to take care of anoth issu . commun with the hospit about the issu and wa given excus by risk manag , who had call me .
<unk> dinner is fantast . servic wa great . perhap my favorit korean restaur now !
thi is the onli mcdonald i 've ever been to that doe n't fill their larg fri up to the top . i 've been through the drive-thru at thi locat 3 time now and everi time ha been the same . you would think it would take more effort to tri to fill it half full then to just fill it to the top .
if i could give these <unk> neg star i would . go on 2 month deal with these peopl , after 3 week of tri to get them to pick up empti bottl and 2 full bottl i did n't need , now they ca n't seem to pick up the cooler sinc i cancel my servic with them . i call them and of cours have to repeat my stori ( again 3rd time call on thi issu ) , and i am inform that they will be out today to pick it up , <unk> , so did n't you peopl think it would be a good idea to call me and schedul it ? ! ! ! now i 'm at work and no way for them to pick it up , so i tell them , i will leav the cooler on my <unk> and whenev your driver want to swing by and get it they can . she tri to advis me that i am <unk> for anyth that happen to the cooler , i tell her that sinc your compani <unk> on servic , that it is no longer under contract and i will not be held respons for anyth that happen to it ... <unk> <unk> ... do not use thi servic ! !
not realli a great filipino restaur but hey you ca n't expect much from ani fast food joint anyway . when i 'm crave filipino food but in a rush thi is the place i go . not the greatest menu . honestli , i onli like the <unk> with their chicken combo . the chicken tast great especi when dip in that gravi sauc they give along with it . if you 've never tri filipino food , i suggest go to an authent filipino dine in restaur . i do n't want you to think thi is how filipino food is suppos to tast like . 3 star ! ca n't realli complain sinc it is a fast food joint . the mcdonald 's of filipino food .
food wa great as usual . server wa on top of <unk> tabl . great job , ashley ! the best thing about egg work is the consist . they are great for sunday brunch .
let me set the scene , date night , we were the first tabl sat at 5pm . i went by at 11am to pick out a tabl , drop the rose and give instruct for how i would like the tabl prepar . <unk> fail ! we were sat at the wrong tabl , the rose wa on a tabl i did not pick , the candl wa not lit . and we were sat against the window where the sun wa in our eye so then we had to switch seat and place our back to the window . now a good start but let move <unk> food wa spectacular , i highli recommend the truffl ravioli . ( i almost <unk> the plate ) the server wa extrem attent and knowledg on the food . i hate that i cant rememb hi name to give him credit . ( upstair juli <unk> shave head ) overal excel experi except for the fact that i took the effort to come in and pick out a tabl away from the window so the <unk> would not be in our eye and that i gave fairli specif instruct as to how i want the rose on the tabl and candl lit as we sat . next time i will have the host repeat the instruct . -- side note -- it wa restaur week , and there were onli 4 tabl for me to choos from when i show up at 11am , i chose the best out of the 4 and a five pm seat time so we could make it to the theater at <unk> . there were onli 6 tabl sat by the time we left at <unk> <unk> . my point , we should have had our pick of the <unk> for tabl .
thi is not the same place it use to be , and most of the review and pictur are from befor the <unk> chang . went a few time with the old owner and love it , but go back now , it 's not even close to the same experi ! not worth your time , go somewher els !
kinda expens , but the best on town , gone are <unk> king crab leg . : - ( , crepe anyon ?
in plan our next trip to vega , we 're go back to the desert rose ! it incred afford consid it averag to less than $ <unk> for a suit that ha a full kitchen and sleep at least 4 peopl . for my 30th birthday some of us went to vega and thi wa bare off the strip , just across from the mgm and behind the tropicana . everi room ha a balconi , bed are super comfi , free <unk> breakfast and a nice workout room . the kitchen is a full kitchen in that it ha everyth you 'll need except the food . a groceri store is <unk> a 10 minut drive away sinc my birthday is in januari we did n't get a chanc to enjoy the pool but overal thi place is definit worth it . i like to spend my $ on eat out and hit the differ spot on the strip . thi place offer comfort for a reason price .
yesterday i went for a <unk> test for my car , spent about 10 minut with a love old guy , who as so bore ( i wa hi onli client all day ) he not to tell me the stori of hi life , no that wa not that great , he learn hi lesson a littl to late , but i learn right in time that i can <unk> the registr of my car in less that two minut ! i have no idea who deserv the credit , but what a great idea thi wa ! a <unk> <unk> right insid a veri popular store ! sorri i do n't shop here , but i will see you again next year to <unk> my registr without <unk> a day in line at <unk> : )
we were here for an <unk> dinner on valentin 's day . our cold dish were veri good but our hot dish were serv at room temperatur . the pasta in particular wa <unk> and <unk> , but by the time we rais the issu ( <unk> , both of us were be polit ) it wa too late , and most of the small serv wa gone . in all fair the pasta wa taken off the bill , and a free dessert wa offer ; but we did not want dessert . what we want wa a perfect meal for the occas , and for the price . will not be back for a long time , if ever . have had better experi at <unk> <unk> .
i love the fact that thi restaur ha a separ deliv servic where they can bring the food to you $ 20 dollar min is okay with me . especi when the food is good ! i will recommend thi restaur to anyon who want some good chines food .
i 've alreadi heard bad thing about thi place but i thought i would give it a tri and i have to say it wa the worst saturday night i 've had ! all of the staff wa rude , dj wa terribl and sound like he could n't make up hi mind in music , bouncer wa just the worst when i first arriv , <unk> wa terribl and over price for what it <unk> just seem like they tri to clean out your wallet , there wa at least 3 fight and thi place ha a reput on that . the onli peopl i actual like wa the valet worker when i wa leav ! stick with the <unk> thi place is horribl !
<unk> pizza compani can be a fun place to pop in when you 've been out and about in the district and need a quick bite to eat . howev base on a varieti of reason i had to give it 3 star . there are mani kind of pizza . at <unk> they serv some kind of altern <unk> which in my opinion is n't a winner . they do howev delici pizza bread sandwich which are serv with fresh chip . the chip are n't as good as their <unk> <unk> fri w/ jalapeno and onion and <unk> dip . i have never been comfort in thi restaur do to the fact the seat is made up of <unk> bench booth . if you like to play video <unk> and drink beer they have a bar which accommod these function ( neither of which is my style ) .
i just tri thi place out after see the posit yelp review and it more than deliv ! there were a few peopl ahead of me in line , but they were veri effici and it wa just a few minut befor my enchilada wa come out of the oven . i like that they let me make my two enchilada differ so i could tri more option ( fill , sauc , and chees ) . they came out of the oven <unk> and i ad salsa <unk> , <unk> , and chees . it 's rare that i finish all my food and i wa <unk> the dish clean . also <unk> some pumpkin cooki to go . they 're soft and <unk> with a delici ice . everyon should definit give thi place a tri !
super friendli staff who gave us some water bottl as we walk the field for the first time with the kid . my kid love it and the pear juic they sold wa so good . we will definit be back and highli recommend !
thi place is definit one of the best kbbq base restaur in mississauga . my friend and i were go to anoth kbbq to eat , but it wa overpr ( not name to be nice lol ) . we decid to come from one side of mississauga to get to thi one , and it wa worth the ride for sure . first thing first , sinc most of my friend were get korean bbq for the first time , we had no idea what to order . right away when we said that , the waiter wa like , `` whi do n't i just bring 2 of everyth so you guy can see what you want to order ? you are grow ! need to eat more ! '' . that guy wa the nicest guy there , and we compliment him for the rest of the meal . there wa also anoth waiter that wa n't our , but he serv our tabl sometim and wa a littl bit more rude . but do n't worri , just ask for a guy name <unk> to serv your tabl ! ( i think ) second , the food . oh boy . we tri everyth , even the side dish , and there wa not one thing that we did n't like . thi restaur is n't even run by <unk> korean peopl , but it wa better than most i 've went to ! they give you an incred gener amount of rice , each dish is like premium qualiti , and drink were realli good too for ayc . lastli , the price . the first one we went to cost us $ 25 for dinner per person on a friday , with absolut no varieti at all ( onli meat , no seafood ) . here it 's onli $ 16 , and they have everyth !
the tabl were dirti . they did not have chip readi and did n't <unk> the <unk> or mint <unk> . they were <unk> the drink bar an hour and half befor close . servic wa slow and not that friendli . food wa delici . playlist wa on point .
who doe n't love warm light donut with your favorit top ! ! me i do ! ! made to order .. serv <unk> order one of the favorit or custom your donut to your like ! ! these are light cake donut .. in the window they advertis the flavor of the <unk> today wa strawberri glaze , <unk> cracker & marshmallow <unk> messi good ! ! i also had the chocol glaze with crush peanut & peanut butter drizzl .. delish ! ! $ <unk> you can also custom a coffe drink to wash it all down ! thi is a 5-star place but i hate order from an <unk> checkout point .. no one to walk you through the process or offer ani suggest for a first time custom . tri to figur out where to slide my debit card wa a bit confus but i got it figur out . i will definit be back for a sweet treat & coffe !
been here sever time , <unk> is fabul ! pizza and appet are high qualiti and happi hour rock too ! we love go there often , i recommend tri all of their dessert , especi the salt caramel <unk> !
there 's alway a vari crowd at <unk> 's and it 's never pack so it 's a great place to just chill . the drink special and happi hour special are unbeat . 50 cent oyster are great . ( i think the special run sun - fri 4 - 7pm ) and wed night is half price wine night .
i went with my famili when we stay at caesar 's and it wa the worst meal of the trip . the servic wa sub-par , but the food wa wors . i wish he had stuck to true pub food becaus he miss the mark on be someth more . when you order pub fri , you expect fri . instead we got potato block . the steak wa just ok and that should be fairli easi to get right . it 's iron that he ha a tv show about bad restaur , becaus hi is not what i would call good . even if the meal had n't cost $ 500 , it still would n't have been good . do n't wast your time , your money , or your calori .
veri good food and larg portion size so you definit get what you pay for . would recommend as locat is nice and good citi <unk> . food take a reason time to prepar . onli concern is that their burger patti should have more flavour and season .
thi use to be an excel salon , howev after chang manag sever time , it is horribl now ! i call on a saturday afternoon - ask what time they close . i wa clearli told 7:30 , at which i repeatedli verifi sever time to confirm ! ! i got there at <unk> , and wa seat right away . i opt for the <unk> - offer at $ <unk> - as a `` manag special '' . what a joke thi turn out to be ! ! one did the pedicur while anoth ( the one that told me they were open till 7:30 ) did the <unk> manicur . i did n't want color polish on my nail , and after file and do a hurri job of cuticl <unk> , she wa done . i ask if she wa go to put ani polish at all , like clear or someth , and final she did that . they were hurri me through , then at <unk> - everyon start pack up their belong to leav . i honestli think that the young ladi told me they close at 7:30 becaus she probabl figur i would n't come in if i knew that they would onli be open for 30 min after i got there . in addit to the bad manicur , my pedicur is terribl - she do n't <unk> the <unk> veri <unk> , nor did she <unk> the cuticl around my toe , so there is still dead skin around the <unk> . basic , i need to go to a more reput salon for anoth <unk> if i want it done correctli . as for clean the pedicur <unk> ? after two other young ladi left from get their pedicur , i watch as they use a `` <unk> '' cleaner in a spray bottl that did not smell of bleach or ani kind of <unk> . now you know what happen when the foot <unk> and tool are n't clean correctli - we 've all seen and heard thi in the news ! ! ! hello <unk> <unk> ! ! ! http : <unk> never again will i go there , thi nail salon ha obvious run it cours - at least for me ! !
thi place wa delici . i wa not onli impress with the food , i wa impress with the custom servic . <unk> wa our waiter and he wa veri attent and help . he also chat with us which is good . highli recommend .
need to get out of the hous saturday afternoon . mild case of <unk> <unk> after the big snow event over the last few day . thi is a veri new locat near <unk> mall and i had yet to tri it so away i went . stop in for a few beer , wing , and a basketbal game on tv . <unk> wa play so the place wa pretti busi . typic <unk> in everi way which is to say solid but noth award win . wing were tasti , beer wa cold , servic at the bar wa fine . i had experi i want and expect so <unk> .

wa in the mood for some crepe sunday am and decid if i went earli i would beat the post patti 's celebr crowd . perfect plan i tell you , about <unk> straight to a tabl street side . a littl disappoint in the lack of crepe on the menu as they had onli <unk> crepe . howev my server explain that `` thin pancak '' are realli big crepe . i opt for the lemon and fruit `` thin pancak '' , with a doubl shot espresso and a fruit cup on the side . espresso - wow , i wa super disappoint as i wa imagin myself sit in pari sip espresso in a cafe . thi espresso wa realli bad . it wa made perfectli ( textur and color ) but wa bitter and just a bad roast . now i am sort of a espresso <unk> come from seattl howev i do n't feel that have high expect for espresso in a french cafe is too much to ask . i expect an <unk> roast and someth veri smooth , wrong . now the thin pancak were excel . i wa veri happi with the flavor but the <unk> size liter made me think thi is so not french . it wa massiv and wast when it came to pure size of the pancak themselv , howev it wa pretti stingi on the fruit top ( possibl 3 strawberri slice up ) . the flavor wa veri good and would have seem somehow even better , if it were in short suppli make me savor each bite . howev with thi huge portion it i ate until i wa veri full and still sent back half a plate of food . overal a good experi but if you are a french bistro in a french theme hotel ; they might want to send the manag to <unk> , pari in particular , to see how the french realli eat and live . it seem like a french claim <unk> or someth when it came to portion , and a <unk> of a coffe pastri place . i think they need to focu a littl more on tri to serv great food and minim the portion to a reason level and stop tri to be everyth to everyon . i imagin accommod the <unk> pack crowd is a challeng as you have to to make end meet on the strip howev , most <unk> <unk> are not order the thin pancak and espresso . do the <unk> thing on the american item but make some craft product for peopl who are real foodi . you do n't have to total sell out to make the dollar . as far as price , i wa a littl surpris consid the $ 25.00 bill with $ 5 tip . $ 30 for crepe and espresso ? i think the espresso wa $ 7 which actual made it even wors than the tast . i might go again , but i might not . probabl better place to fit my crave when i get them .
today i 'm <unk> , i have been eat thai food from locat mostli on the east side , we happen to see thi locat and decid to tri . mi <unk> is my favorit appet except for <unk> ( beef ) with peanut sauc . the mi <unk> wa not cook ( actual partial <unk> ) correctli and tast of dirti oil and mayb sweet and sour sauc gone wrong . share with the server but instead server just said would you like to take home . mi took it home <unk> want a second opinion , they agre nasti end in the trash . the <unk> thai wa okay except shrimp were not cook crunchi . peanut sauc wa okay . what i did notic wa that most peopl stuck with menu item that are more chines style than thai . price were $ $ $ pricey . i 'll stick to the east side for thai food . i 've read some of the review and comment on soup right on ... save your money and go east phoenix for real thai food .

attend second week of august , and the whole parti wa disappoint . we were realli look for a new place to hang outsid on the water . the good : servic wa wonder , with our waitress be realli attent , and <unk> drink over and over . the view overlook the water is beauti , and enough to get us back one more time . there wa no wit , and veri few peopl there for 6 pm on a weekday . plenti of room to park . the upgrad over the bourbon street grill is notic , and they did a <unk> job with <unk> , tile and clean line . the bad : the pizza wa <unk> bad , after they hype it as the best dish on the menu . imagin take an inch of think dough and put flavor ketchup on it ( but not enough ) . it did n't say <unk> dish ' on the menu , and we were all surpris . we <unk> over who would take the leftov home , but not the good way . dog were the big winner that night , and they ate a lot . they need to <unk> the menu , work on the pizza , and shave the price a littl , and they should get the volum thi place could deserv . i realli want to see it work , but so far , not so much .
zero star ... order onlin through <unk> <unk> ... <unk> wait for an hour noth show up , tri call no answer ... had a hungri famili so i then order d more pizza but from <unk> , my order <unk> m <unk> show up 30 min after order wa place , come to find out it wa close talk to grub <unk> and got my money refund but wa still so irrit .
after read decent review my husband and i decid to order takeout from here . we both got burrito and wow , how disappoint . $ 11 for a tortilla over stuf with rice . both of our burrito had littl to no meat . i kept bite into mine wait for the chicken . i end up have three bite of chicken out of a huge burrito . menu said <unk> bean came on the side ( neither of us got bean ) . no flavor in either of our burrito <unk> . it all seem bland , bore , and way overpr . extrem disappoint . taco bell would have been better than thi place .
awesom servic ! <unk> their salad bar ! would come here again : d <unk> & cuisin class <unk> kim
after dinner last night , i realiz i had been to <unk> a dozen time and i felt it wa final time to give <unk> some <unk> . it 's next to my yoga studio so it 's alway been a great spot to grab a bite with my friend after class . there is a reason whi it is often describ as a littl `` neighborhood gem '' - it 's exactli that . you will be greet with a smile and - speak from my experi - the servic is alway great . i <unk> over some other review and a lot of peopl seem realli stuck on the concept of have spanish and asian on the same menu . so , for those new to charlott , i 'll give you a littl histori on how that came to be . you probabl alreadi know that spanish food is still hard to come by in charlott - well , back in the earli <unk> 's the owner of <unk> use to have anoth gem call <unk> spanish grill ( down the street where kid <unk> just open ) , it wa sister restaur to <unk> spanish grill , which if i 'm right is <unk> rate and still <unk> in <unk> . at the time have just return from live in <unk> , <unk> wa one of my absolut favorit spot - especi sinc nobodi els in charlott seem to have an <unk> for spanish cuisin . i wa <unk> when i heard they were close becaus the build had gotten bought by a new patron . howev the result of thi wa <unk> - and as a former patron and fan of <unk> , that alreadi set the bar high for me . <unk> get five star simpli for essenti be a part of our neighborhood for more than a decad - and for continu to fill that void in our citi for spanish cuisin . we have to appreci restaur for the passion behind them and for what they bring to market they serv . a five star review doe n't mean it ha to be a five star restaur . i have been to michelin star restaur , and if you learn anyth from that is that they do n't follow the rule . <unk> is n't tri to break barrier by put asian and spanish on the same menu - to me , it is a great spanish restaur that ha <unk> itself to includ an asian fare , a solid choic for good food and an <unk> dine experi .
just like the other <unk> locat in term of food and decor . servic is realli good . brunch is yummi - i recommend the french toast . i like all of the sandwich i 've tri and the hummu as an appet is realli nice . there 's cocktail special on the weekend if you want to get <unk> dure brunch .
i love thi store onc i found it . i work out next door at planet fit and discov thi cloth exchang store one day . nice , use cloth and accessori . i am alway clean out my closet and could exchang my own cloth for store credit . i knew if i did n't have money , i would alway be abl to go shop with my store credit . now they close with no notic , no phone call , noth ! ! ! i had $ <unk> credit from my cloth i turn in . that is like they <unk> from me . me and my boyfriend would regularli talk to them and thought they were pretti honest . they said at one time they were go to <unk> , but i guess not . i am sure they sold everyon 's cloth at a yard sale . i guess onc again i learn not to trust too mani peopl .
dinner time for thi senior coupl . plenti of seat in a wide open space . read the menu pricey but a new establish . go to order nice gentleman in a tie tri 's to take our order . i wa have a club sandwich , my husband want a burger . that 's when the troubl start . no substitut . we prefer to have salad with our meal instead of fri . these place do not want to accommod diet need . fri , salad near the same food cost . there are plenti of place to eat in vega but thi will not be one . use to love el <unk> steak hous . to bad .
my husband and i had been want to tri <unk> tavern sinc befor it open and final got the chanc . they have lot of patio seat that is <unk> <unk> with <unk> for the summer time , and an equal amount of seat insid . the bar is rather larg for the establish size so there are plenti of seat . lot 's of game on , and tv 's were <unk> from ani seat there . the servic wa great , our waitress wa veri attent and quick with drink . we split the pretzel and <unk> dip as an appet , share a dozen wing and a basket of onion ring for dinner . the food wa great , everyth came out fairli quickli , hot and cook just right . they have a great select of beer ! they do n't make frozen margarita ( <unk> whi ... ) i wish they had happi hour , ( i think we would visit more often ) but <unk> tavern wa wonder and we will definit be back ! great dine experi !
thi place is realli good . it is a bit pricey but the hot pot are amaz . i would n't get the fri shrimp but everyth els wa great !
thi is a realli cute place , i love that they have readi made frozen meal and can <unk> veget . i 've been here a few time but i have n't tri ani of those . what i did have , yesterday , wa a <unk> sandwich - in the style of a philli <unk> sandwich . and i got the first <unk> <unk> and next day <unk> that i 've experienc sinc go vegan a coupl of month ago . the sandwich wa pretti good , a littl heavi on the black pepper but otherwis <unk> . i like vegan <unk> food and i 'm glad thi exist but becaus of my ... <unk> issu ... i will probabl never have it again . dessert ! in the past i 've had a donut ( $ 3 ) , a chocol chip cooki ( ~ $ 3 ) . yesterday i pick up a $ <unk> browni . they all look amaz . they were all <unk> disappoint . no <unk> with the dessert but the cooki seem stale , hard throughout and <unk> onli by dip it in my coffe for <unk> . the donut , appl bourbon i believ it wa , had tasti ice . the donut is massiv which seem to justifi the price tag but it 's dens , tough , dri , and tasteless . i think make a much smaller donut with a more balanc ice to donut ratio would be a huge improv . i tri to keep eat the donut and browni becaus i had invest so much money and hope into both of them and i 'm not one to give up easili but ultim both had to be <unk> , <unk> . custom servic wa ok . there 's anoth vegan place across the street that i frequent , sandwich are simpl , cheap ( <unk> ) , and tasti . dessert are alway delici . custom servic is alway excel . edit : out of <unk> ate my boyfriend 's <unk> sandwich that i left out on the counter <unk> for breakfast and it wa still pretti good . <unk> star .
<unk> and hi whole staff could n't have been <unk> and the food wa amaz ... 5 star experi at such an afford price is <unk> a must go !
we love the atmospher , servic , food , drink and especi their happi hour . the <unk> <unk> wa a perfect share plate . the pork and chicken were moist and went well with the mustard sauc . the shrimp had a nice flavor . we ate the pita with the spici pepper . my friend want to order more .
i like jerki as much as - if not more than - the next guy . and that is not meant to <unk> all you ladi out there who like your meat , it is usual just <unk> to keep <unk> to a singl sex . the male choic just seem to make more sens here . most of us are familiar onli with one sort of jerk meat for sale - that advertis by the late `` <unk> man '' <unk> <unk> , and be the one that come press into a <unk> <unk> , if somewhat logic , form - yet you can snap it if you so choos , as if to say `` i can snap my meat , and that is good '' . for all of you who have been search for more , you have found your <unk> . here , <unk> line the wall with dozen of jerki flavor , where you can select your own meat by the pound . sanit ? appar not necessari . <unk> and <unk> <unk> pack hang from hook throughout the store if the <unk> give you the <unk> , and you even have the option to pick up a blend for your own meat if you so choos . also make sure to grab a card in case you are a <unk> meat <unk> , and get it <unk> on each visit to the outlet . the onli downsid , other than the possibl sanit issu ? the select is perhap a bit weak . your somewhat standard beef , turkey and even <unk> is avail , but some more <unk> meat would be a good thing . bison , <unk> , <unk> ? not here . mayb one day , when meat jerk is more accept .
excel divers select of mostli organ food . good choic of prepar food for restrict diet includ gluten free , vegetarian , vegan and <unk> . but no one is go to shop here for cheap food - veri high qualiti doe n't come cheap . check servic is usual friendli . custom servic within the store is total hit or miss - sometim the staff is extrem <unk> to help and sometim the are just not interest . hour are also less custom friendli than other nearbi specialti food shop like sun valley .
first time here and definit my last . custom servic suck , the wait is ridicul and the food is not that great . i 've had better .
myself and three of my ladi friend had dinner last night . park is terribl but that is not one eleven bistro fault . i wa veri disappoint in my wedg salad that wa just a half head of lettuc cut in half put on a plate with veri littl dress and veri littl tast . the mussel were veri weird tast and would never order again . my friend dinner were just so so for a veri expens cost . the servic wa good except our waitress had <unk> with our check and give back the correct chang . would not recommend thi place at thi time . mayb in the futur the food will be better .
outstand taco here i highli recommend thi place to everyon who love good mexican food ! !
the food at one of a kind pasta & grill is excel ! surprisingli excel ! our meal start out with complementari garlic bread , which wa delici and veri fresh . we order the butter chicken <unk> and the mac and chees and both were top notch . these dish were complet differ , but both were prepar with a level of skill that i wa not expect . my companion , who is of indian <unk> and a <unk> butter chicken <unk> , wa veri impress with the flavour of the butter chicken sauc . the mac and chees ( rigatoni with black forest ham and pea in a <unk> cream sauc but i got it without the ham ) wa fantast , but quit differ from what most peopl would expect when they order such a <unk> dish . the flavour were veri <unk> ; not bland but not obviou it 's a bit hard to describ , but do n't expect cheddar chees sauc and a <unk> crust ! the portion were reason - not <unk> massiv but you definit wo n't leav hungri - and the price were great . dinner for two with drink ( but no dessert ) came to about $ <unk> . we found the servic quick and attent , although the restaur wa not veri busi on the night we were there . i have to admit that i wa a bit <unk> of thi place initi - it doe n't look like much from the outsid and i 'm alway <unk> of a larg menu with seemingli random <unk> such as indian and asian ( in addit to the obviou italian theme ) , but somehow it all work . i would definit eat here again !
the interior is super charm , nice staff . but i wa n't impress with the meal overal and like wo n't be back . i had the $ <unk> beef . although cook perfectli , it wa about 2 ounc of beef . <unk> 3 . it 's just not appropri for a main dish . when ask about the food , i brought thi up and the server said `` ye , sorri i should have mention it wa veri small . '' the peach salad wa bland . the beef salad wa good as wa the tomato tart . overal , given the price i 'll pass .
thi place wa superb ! it wa recommend by local ( and clearli <unk> <unk> ) and did not disappoint . the <unk> dip ( for the bread ) is outstand ! it 's differ than your standard butter or oil and it 's a standout befor you even start eat . appet : we start with the tuna tartar which wa a larger portion than usual ! it wa chop up into <unk> piec and serv with a few <unk> chip across the top rather than a few big chunk . i think i prefer it thi way . entre : the fish of the day wa sold out , but the replac wa scallop and they were delici . the chef prepar them with some fingerl potato and some oliv oil , but whatev it wa had so much flavor . and there were so mani scallop . i would get thi everi time i went to dinner if i could . my husband had the cab prime ny strip becaus he `` had '' to tri it . and while i know he love it , i 'm still not <unk> the whole cab , <unk> , cab prime , is n't some <unk> to make you pay more . side : green bean -- these were so good . the <unk> and <unk> nut match perfectli . i would total get these again . if i live in cleveland , i would come back here again and again .
been here befor in summer did a mani pedi but the mani did not last and <unk> while at a wed . today <unk> 6 , tri them again as price is one of <unk> in area and they are veri nice here . the owner is push the shellac ( + $ 15 ) on top of normal pedi ( $ 20 ) becaus the pedi will be ruin by winter boot ... <unk> never knew . she wa veri <unk> that thi wa realli necessari but afterward let me think about it and when <unk> not to there wa n't ani awkward . they cover the tub each time with a plastic bag so that is good . the place is a bit date and <unk> but the price point and loyalti card keep thi place busi . they have free wifi and play current <unk> movi on the flat screen , cuz watch <unk> on <unk> get old fast ! the park lot is small and it 's alway pack dure meal time due to <unk> <unk> next door , great real thai food btw . oh and i watch the ladi place all tool into the sanit machin after . glad to give them a second tri . will edit review when i get home to see if the regular polish <unk> the <unk> boot go home . edit : i made it home in winter boot with nail polish in <unk> ! <unk> ! ! the <unk> , spray someth on the basic polish and even wrap the toe in <unk> wrap so it would n't <unk> . that wa <unk> thought and sincer sinc i cheap out on not get the shellac on the toe . thi second experi help fix the first visit mistak , so i will <unk> again . plu watch <unk> <unk> here is kinda fun = )

i realli like thi littl place . the server and bartend are alway super nice , and the sushi is on the same `` signatur '' roll you would see at <unk> . they also have other stuff like rice dish and such for non sushi fan , and it 's cheap ! they do <unk> from 4 to 7 and 11 to 1 everi day , sweet ! oh , and they have a free video <unk> . you get a list of some <unk> kind of like your sushi card , mark the one you want to see and give it to the server or dj and <unk> ! you get to see and hear your song . pretti cool . insid and outsid seat , veri <unk> decor , def cater to the younger crowd ( same as <unk> ) .
we been there a coupl time onc at the bar on a busi day ok servic pizza can be a bit better the first time we sat at the patio and all the tabl around wa dirti until the end some one came to clean all at onc no a good site went you tri to enjoy your meal ... well happi hour is ok and now better on tuesday on the wine deal i just wish the had a revers happi hour befor close ... . by the way the have 19 <unk> <unk> tri to collect all 19 <unk> lol
i came here to do some partial highlight . i 'm korean so i cant speak japanes but the girl that were work on my hair were so kind and friendli .
petit japanes with a <unk> patio on <unk> . but the <unk> stop there . the food wa `` meh '' at best . my pork <unk> <unk> wa underwhelm , and the pork wa kind of soggi and tasteless . i <unk> a few sushi roll from my dine partner and they did n't seem too fresh or interest either . after eat a piec of avocado as soft as <unk> , <unk> , too soft , i gave up . for a place that advertis themselv as the `` best japanes restaur in toronto '' they fall quit short of the mark . <unk> titl <unk> : i 'd avoid thi <unk> , joe . menu <unk> : although well laid out , it 's <unk> too long . need to mention : for what it 's worth : the portion size are good for the money . what thi place <unk> me about myself : i have not eaten at the best japanes restaur in toronto .
holi <unk> , how come we do n't have one of these in <unk> ? they might could give <unk> a run for their money , lol . take in mind thi review is base sole on my breakfast purchas of the tastiest chicken biscuit i have had to date . the chicken is cajun and season perfectli , not too spici , perfect amount of heat . chicken breast wa veri juici , not dri at all . the biscuit wa soft , fluffi and also had a great butteri flavor as well . hand in hand the cajun chicken pair perfectli with the biscuit , which i might add wa hearti in size as well . i would so opt for their cajun chicken biscuit over the spici chicken biscuit from <unk> becaus sometim their is a hit and miss with the size of meat and heat level . whenev i get back to these part , i am go to look for a <unk> and tear up anoth biscuit , lol . the fri chicken look fantast so i know i want to tri that also . lucki all of you that have one of these nearbi ; can you <unk> me one , lol
<unk> , of <unk> , ha been do my cut and color for sever year now , and when she chang salon , i move with her . she know exactli what i want , and listen to my thought befor give her profession opinion . the staff here at <unk> is no differ - they 're all veri friendli and help , and alway offer a beverag on arriv ! the salon itself is in a <unk> <unk> hous in <unk> , which they have complet remodel on the insid to make it super modern . there 's alway good music pump through the speaker to make your appoint fun , and go by much <unk> than you expect it to ! i 'll be a custom here as long as <unk> is a stylist !
<unk> and the vega vip team gave myself and my friend a fabul time at <unk> <unk> ! they gave us real vip experi ! i would recommend them to everybodi .
<unk> ! whi go to a depart store for name brand <unk> and skin care when you can go to <unk> ! they have everi brand you are look for and a lot of brand that are hard to find at depart store such as an extens select of <unk> . it 's a fun laid back environ with make over section everywher so you can test the makeup befor you buy it . they also have the wall of <unk> for both men and <unk> to my knowledg is the most <unk> i have seen in my life ! the <unk> brand itself ha great deal on makeup and ton of <unk> ... liter anoth wall with at least <unk> kind of <unk> brush . i do n't alway need someth from <unk> , but when i 'm in fashion squar i need to go in . that 's when the five minut <unk> <unk> happen ! a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of lip <unk> , and whatev els <unk> me and i am a new woman ! perfect pick me up if you are go somewher after the mall !
mayb way too mani employe in thi store . <unk> help me right away and guid me to the <unk> path section . i got the buy two get one free bodi spray deal , but in line i notic that one of the bottl wa leak at the top . i mention it as soon as i got to the regist and the ladi ask me if i want anoth one to get the third free . i sad of cours , and i ask her if i need to go get one and she said `` if you want to get the deal '' . so with all of the employe that could have gone to get me one , i had to <unk> my way around them and other custom to the veri front , grab a bottl and <unk> again back to the regist where she wa stare at me like what took you so long . she took my money with not anoth word and hand me my bag like <unk> <unk> here ' . the onli reason they get three star is for <unk> who they should put at the regist for a more pleasant experi .
redeem . wa in a pinch and <unk> were the onli close to work option with sweet potato fri so i decid to swing by . greet as soon as i walk in by a realli friendli team member . she offer help with the menu and made suggest . i am veri pleas i gave it anoth go becaus these fri are bomb ! ! ! thank you for the wonder experi !
i have n't actual been to <unk> donut . howev , i work about a mile away and at least onc a week someon bring some in . best donut ever ? i think i 'll agre .
i got a massag from anoth place 24 hour prior to book here . thi massag match the 5-star rate it consist receiv . it wa well worth the one block walk from the green valley ranch resort . i promis you will enjoy your experi . relax & book now ... best , <unk> s .
again onli about <unk> of their donut were avail upon open they said they chang thi but it 's obvious not the case . thi is the 4th time i 've been here at open or within 1 hour of them open and they onli have <unk> or 1/2 of all their donut readi
<unk> pizza is overal good pizza in phoenix . i have been to sever of the locat and they are fairli consist . they have pizza by the slice , which i like , and you can get all kind of top on your pizza for cheap <unk> . i had a slice with garlic , basil , meatbal , tomato , goat chees , and someth els i ca n't think of right thi second ... .it wa pretti delici . the bf and i share some spinach artichok dip as well , which is alway delici and terribl for you . the servic is somewhat inconsist , sometim it is fast and friendli and sometim it is slow for no appar reason . the last time i went it wa the latter . despit thi , i would go back becaus the pizza is tasti and cheap .
i will never visit thi locat again . the area is not onli shadi but they need better employe . the cashier <unk> did n't not know how to work the regist that great . i wa wait for 10 minut for her to ring someon up . <unk> ! nice ladi but not a compet person .
first of all , i have to say i probabl am not be that fair in my restaur rate , becaus bobbi <unk> kind of seem like a <unk> to me . ok , set asid my <unk> against him as much as i can , i would say my meal wa decent . i order the seven spice chicken or someth that effect . i realli could n't note the complex of the spice in thi dish . i definit wa expect someth that tast a littl <unk> and had more depth . i did notic that my friend 's husband had an amaz look pork dish that i almost <unk> . i think if i tri that dish i would give thi place at least a four . base on my chicken , i 'd have to say thi place wa a 3.5 , but i 'd be will to go back , <unk> my review and give mr. <unk> anoth chanc . i mean , are n't we all <unk> one time or anoth ?
one of my friend <unk> the wynn brunch is the best brunch buffet in vega , but after my most recent visit i 'm not sure . i did n't even pay thi second time , so you know thi review is <unk> about the <unk> , haha ... the dine area is decor like the rest of the wynn with thi <unk> <unk> and fruit theme ... i like that the it spaciou and section off . the <unk> make it realli nice , too . as for the food , i get that they have a great select but i do n't think it 's ani better than most other vega buffet . sure it 's classi , and you do get fanci thing like egg benedict and even beef au ju in the earli morn ... but how it 's absolut amaz is beyond me . i 'll give them one thing -- their dessert section is awesom . i love the freshli made crepe and the gelato ... i think the rio 's gelato is compar though . of the buffet i 've experienc in vega it <unk> rate up higher for me , but that 's becaus i 've been to a lot of those <unk> one . when i 'm pay , it 's a <unk> place , sorri kid . crepe <unk> ( <unk> ) ... worth at least one visit , no need to come back again and again for brunch . though dinner could be anoth stori -- i 'll let you know .
i love thi place ! the <unk> fish taco are my favorit , alway fill , and the staff are veri friendli and effici . a veri clean restaur as well !
my favorit day are the day when my boyfriend suggest we get ice cream ! ! sunday night at <unk> and the line is still to the door ... <unk> so worth the wait ! ! ! such an awesom interior with more candi and sweet and menu item than you can even imagin ! ! i had the mint chocol chip shake and bobbi had the red velvet . both were awesom . he tri some chocol candi that caught hi eye and love them . that say a lot becaus he is not typic a chocol lover . the servic wa friendli , but after you order you have to stand in an awkward space with other wait for your shake . it wa kind of confus and not veri organ . still - no <unk> becaus our sweet teeth ( ? ) were satisfi . price are averag i 'd say . i regret noth about that trip and probabl wont again when we <unk> . 5 star !
are you kid ? i wait in line for 45 minut when they said it wa go to be 15 ! we got in and turn out there were no potato . i mean i ca n't believ there servic ! worst part is the manag though . thi is n't the first time thi ha happen look at other review . if there wa a way thi would be get a 0 star ! ! !
decent place . but the blue rock charg a 5 dollar `` music fee '' i wa not made awar of thi till i receiv my bill . so be care when drink or food is order .
the onli downsid to thi joint is that they do n't have a drive-thru . that 's the downsid if you 're in a rush . the <unk> , when you go insid , is that they do n't have a drive-thru ... so that mean that you have a better idea how long the wait will be . i go there to work <unk> sometim ... so i do n't have to do it at home . i think it 's great . it 's usual rather quiet becaus most peopl are read or work on laptop , so we 're all <unk> . i like the <unk> tabl along the window , and they have outlet all along the window so i can charg up my laptop as i work . pretti <unk> . drink are veri good . as good as ani other starbuck , and the staff is usual friendli . even when the line is long , i do n't wait as long as i do at other locat , so that 's a huge plu ( like becaus there 's no drive-thru )
the chair are realli way too comfi . i did a <unk> through most of hunger game : catch fire . the end wa good though ! lol
i realli like thi restaur . it is spaciou and clean . it is one of the few place that me and my friend keep go . the <unk> tan <unk> and chicken <unk> are what we alway get . they have the best <unk> in town ! ! yum <unk> recent i tri the <unk> <unk> and it becam anoth of my favorit . there are a few thing i would avoid : 1 . <unk> chicken rice . it is not great . phoenix restaur ha the best <unk> chicken rice in toronto . 2 . the milk tea . it tast good but super strong ! ! i had two sip at dinner time and it kept me <unk> till <unk> in the morn .
sunday morn the cornbread hit the spot . the rest of the meal , food and servic , wa mediocr at best . to tell the truth , the servic ran along the line of pretti poor . we sat outsid and the tabl around us were annoy with the bad servic too . actual the woman at the tabl of three directli across from us kept tell custom to `` go away '' when they came dine . she also wa serv the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her . we start the meal with the fri green tomato - fresh green tomato batter in a herb and <unk> blend , lightli fri to perfect and serv with our own <unk> sauc - it wa serv with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plate but never did . she never refil our drink either . the fri green tomato had a veri heavi batter on them . it wa hard to find `` tomato '' in the dish . i would <unk> tri thi appet . we wait a long time for our main cours which is whi it wa probabl cold when it arriv at our tabl . <unk> had the special beef tip omelet with potato . he had ask for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white . they never bought the toast or ask if hi meal wa good . i tri the <unk> 's famou salmon cake . these were dri and cold and my side the macaroni & chees - tasti - and <unk> & tomato - greasi ? - were also suffer from be left sit wait for someon to bring them to our tabl . after final chase someon down insid we got our check . with all the option in the neighborhood to tri we probabl wo n't add thi to our list of great place to dine .
i 've been here twice so far and the food ha been so delici both time . first time , i went with my husband . i order a mocha ( delici ) and the <unk> chicken and waffl . both were pretti good . my husband order the salmon egg scrambl and a burger which were both delici ! we had come in dure the busi brunch time on saturday but our waitress wa wonder ! got our drink and order put in quickli and check on us to make sure we were do well . second time , i went with my mom and brother . again , we were seat right away but no one came to our tabl for a good 10 minut . the woman who wa suppos to help us did n't acknowledg or even look our way onc even though she wa serv the tabl right next to us . the <unk> who did end up help us after see me get a littl <unk> wa veri kind and quickli got us our drink and our order . although we were there around almost 3pm and there wa onli 4 other tabl with custom , they seem understaf still . it wa our waiter and the other waitress but they seem to be all over the place . our food wa still veri delici and although thi visit wa n't as amaz as the first , our waiter still do a good job and definit save the day .
thi is one of my go-to spot , especi on sunday . most breakfast place have long wait , but mari 's alway seem to be abl fit me in with minimum wait ; it 's truli a hidden <unk> . ani of the hash are great ; the potato are alway crispi and the egg are perfect . they alway bring out a larg platter of uniqu jam and jelli that are made in-hous , so i 'm alway <unk> to come back and tri someth i have n't had yet . the decor is veri tradit and feel like home . i love thi place and see myself come here for a long time . total worth stop by if you 're in the area .
love the vibe of thi place as well as the usual crowd . seem to be a lot of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc that hang out here which is a great break from the usual hipster place in la vega . it 's small , but i like it ! saw <unk> <unk> here last month and had a fun time . bonu : bartend are smoke hot ! ; )
wow . i ca n't believ i have n't review thi place yet . so i love the <unk> thing in life , do n't get me wrong . and vega ha sooo much to offer in thi regard . and then there 's la <unk> anytim time after 1 am . on each trip to vega i ca n't go without visit la <unk> . it is the most amaz peopl watch . remind me of the bar <unk> bay use to have right in the middl where the <unk> alway hung out . you realli see it all here . <unk> . especi after a few cocktail . the ladi of the night are everywher . and the john 's `` in the know '' about thi provid ampl <unk> for convers . note : these are not wynn <unk> ladi of the night . these are <unk> work women . i also love the band that use to play there . not sure if they still do . they had a lead <unk> who wa great . step asid steel <unk> ! <unk> 's in town ! he could sing it all - from <unk> to <unk> . did i mention the danc that goe on ? anyway , if you 're look for the pretti peopl and a vega <unk> - go somewher els . if you 're look for some good peopl watch , thi is your spot !

if you 're look to see the owner of thi furnitur shop pretend to be a sale rep and then yell at hi wife in front of us to get out of the room , then thi is the place ! if you 're look for thi same owner to yell at you to get out of the store while you are tri to negoti deliveri charg , then thi is the place ! the first time i visit la <unk> furnitur , i had a veri good experi with a staff member name <unk> . the couch we were look for wa not on display on the floor , so he wa kind enough to let us into the back of the warehous and cut open a new couch for us to see and sit on . he had mention there is <unk> room for negoti and we should tri speak with the asian man with glass behind the counter . my girlfriend and i still want to shop around , so decid to come back on a futur date . fast forward to novemb <unk> , we went back again . thi time <unk> wa n't work so we decid to wait for the asian man with glass behind the store counter , who wa busi serv other custom . anoth asian man decid to help us , albeit he wa a bit less polish individu . he had use car <unk> written all over hi face . i told him that we had <unk> with <unk> last time and we were told if we paid in cash , we would pay about 8 % tax and could have deliveri charg includ in the price sinc we live veri close to the store . he had also mention that despit us give a cash deal , tax are of cours regist and paid for , so we still get warranti after we purchas the couch . i want to negoti an <unk> price which wa the retail of the couch $ <unk> includ deliveri charg and tax . thi sale rep said he would go speak with the owner and get us the best price . sinc he work on <unk> , he will tri hi best to close the sale as he told us . he come back with two price : $ <unk> + $ <unk> deliveri + tax = $ <unk> or $ <unk> if we 're pay by credit card . i found it odd that i wa pay an extra 5 % if i use credit card , consid <unk> charg <unk> <unk> % to 3 % for credit card fee . so someth <unk> wa go on for sure . i told him that $ <unk> for deliveri charg are veri high consid how close we live . he then start to tell us that they use a 3rd parti from <unk> which charg a flat rate regardless of where you live in the citi . thi make no sens to me , consid i clearli see deliveri truck outsid thi store and there is no way a place thi big doe n't do deliveri themselv . read past review , it 's veri clear they deliv the furnitur themselv . immedi when we went to speak with someon els , he start speak in <unk> as if i did n't understand . he told him that `` he ha alreadi <unk> with the wife '' . also in front of other custom who were <unk> , he told us that he doe n't play game and he ha alreadi given us a discount on deliveri charg sinc we were asian . i told him , i do n't even know what you normal charg but $ <unk> for a 15 minut drive is <unk> . i also told him i have never paid full retail on furnitur at an <unk> furnitur shop and there is alway room to negoti . i usual tri to <unk> for a 5 % discount , but i wa will to pay retail with deliveri charg includ . the man behind the counter said he will get the owner and he left to the back . he came back with an asian woman who seem to be the owner . both her and the asian man with glass were realli look to close the deal . the ask us question like where we live , ask us about the price we want and were check their price list and see what can be done to meet us halfway . immedi the man start speak <unk> again and say `` do n't <unk> the price by a singl penni ! '' . i then told the man that we 're tri to have a convers with the owner and i want to see what she had to say . at thi point , the man goe absolut nut on everyon . he lose control and say <unk> wa hi brother in law , the man behind the counter wa hi employe , and the woman wa hi wife ! so thi whole time he 's play game and he 's actual one of the owner . he tell then hi wife to shut up and leav the room ! he 's scream at the woman in front of us and other custom . then he turn to us and say , i alreadi told you my best price now i want you to get out of my store ! he then physic <unk> my girlfriend and i out of the store . i wa stun and in <unk> <unk> . i have never been yell at like that befor , especi as a custom .
slightli expens but worth everi <unk> , especi when the weather is right and you sit on their beauti patio , lit by string light and fill with the sound of their beauti fountain . perfect place to take a date or have a special and <unk> even . their wood fire pizza are small but their ingredi are fresh and pair delici with a bottl of wine or a <unk> . thi place fill up fast though so definit make reserv if you 're hope to get a tabl at night .
i came to see the <unk> boy in thi medium size venu . the stage wa nice done . you can see the entir stage in ani of the seat but if you prefer to focu on ani one of them , you can do so with the 5 screen on both side of the stage which would focu on each individu member for some of the song . my onli complaint for thi venu are the bathroom and the seat . there wa onli 1 restroom but it did have a lot of stall . the line did move quickli but it wa out the door and around the corner . as for the seat , it 's pretti wide and comfort with plenti of <unk> . but it gave me a <unk> behind my <unk> . that wa the onli area my skin touch and i broke out . it been <unk> for almost 2 week . wish they had cleaner seat . but do n't let that stop you from see the <unk> boy ! just wear long pant ! <unk> boy get 5 star . the <unk> get 3 !
thi place is great . we were en <unk> to the <unk> firm <unk> not want to deal with a <unk> salesperson when we spot thi place . i have never walk out of ani busi after make a larg purchas feel so confid that i made a great decis . after walk in , have done my research and think i knew exactli what i want , <unk> , the manag wa abl to answer all our question and help us find exactli what we realli need . he wa veri knowledg about the item in the store and wa not pushi or pressur at all . he effect <unk> us for the exact mattress that fit our comfort and budget . i would recommend r & s to anyon in the market for a <unk> .
give the food 5 star . but the servic is neg 2 star . had the hangov burger . veri good . order your egg if you dont want over hard . cole slaw wa good not great but yeah that burger hit the spot . the hostess and waitress where fight the whole time . even <unk> . sorri you ruin a good burger becaus you had a beef ...
fantast compani to work with . took care of our <unk> problem -- <unk> under our <unk> <unk> . clean up <unk> mess , <unk> futur <unk> , fill in <unk> hole too . great commun with <unk> , the owner . cost wa reason . highli recommend !
the place is veri nice . servic wa good . we ate the homemad pretzel which wa fantast . main cours had steak which wa good and we had the chicken salad which wa okay . overal a nice place to go .
i 've been mean to tri thi place out for a realli long time so when i came in , it took me forev to decid sinc most of their option sound super appeal . i went with the <unk> burger which came with avocado `` fri . '' i wa nervou to tri it sinc i 've never had raw vegan food , but to my surpris , it wa yummi and fill ! their price are a bit high , but that is expect with the ingredi they use and the fact that it is vegan and gluten free . i also got the chocol chip cheesecak which wa so damn good that i wish it wa way bigger lol . i realli like the view of the lake and the fact that they have a mini store connect that ha all sort of vegan <unk> you can take home for later . i 'll definit be come back again .
eight of us dine here friday night it wa quick <unk> puppi are good the french fri were good but i should 've known better than to order chicken at a seafood place it left someth to be desir overal everyon said it wa okay
i gener realli like thi place , so leav a 3 star review is pain . i came on a sunday for brunch with 6 other peopl . we wait about 20 minut for a tabl . the restaur wa sever understaf . onc we were seat , we wait anoth 15 minut for ani attent . we were not offer brunch menu and had to look them up onlin . then we wait anoth 15 minut for our drink to arriv . overal the food wa pretti good , but not stellar . it 's been better at thi locat befor .
my sister and i were <unk> between restaur and final settl on <unk> <unk> . we took a littl long in decid and end up arriv at <unk> they close at 10 . i realli did n't want to be that jerk , but i wa so set on <unk> at thi point that i poke my head in and ask if they were still open and they <unk> gave us a tabl . the owner here are from <unk> and the servic definit reflect <unk> genuin , help , and you can tell they take pride in what they 're put out . the potato salad we start with wa more <unk> than i 'm use to for japanes style , but delici nonetheless . it wa smooth with <unk> of crisp appl and cucumb throughout , and <unk> <unk> from the shred egg <unk> through it . the <unk> wa a work of art , truli . perfectli cook <unk> rose rice with crispi golden slice <unk> over the top . my sister had the chicken and <unk> combo while i opt for the <unk> curri . miso soup come with all meal here , and it wa definit a <unk> version . the chicken and shrimp came with cabbag salad with <unk> to dress it on the side , as well as some pickl <unk> . the cabbag salad wa a perfect fresh compliment to the crunchi fri <unk> good . everyth wa cook perfectli and the shrimp were gigant and absolut incred ! the menu state that they use black <unk> prawn and they were n't kid . the <unk> curri wa veri flavor and the curri itself wa thick and could stand up on it own . thi dish came simpli with pickl ginger and wa enorm ! all portion here are enough to make two meal out of , unless the <unk> is so <unk> addict that you just eat until you <unk> yourself . be that it wa my first time here , i wa a <unk> to the whole sauc bit . i 've never ground my own sesam for <unk> sauc , it 's just alway arriv with my meal ! the waitress saw me and came over to explain how it work and got it start for me . she also had to open my bottl of <unk> for me = ( <unk> for servic , but next time i come in i 'll be pro !
my fiancé and i have been look forward to eat at # <unk> sinc we move to charlott , <unk> . we were extrem disappoint with our experi thi past friday . the servic and view wa great but the food wa not . i order the <unk> special and could n't cut my fish becaus it wa not cook all the way . thi complet ruin my appetit for the even . they end up give me a nasti kale salad while they made me scallop . i wa so nervou to eat the scallop becaus i did n't trust that they cook them correctli . overal i wa complet bum out to spend over 90 dollar on a special meal that wa not so special . <unk>
bean burrito tast <unk> or <unk> . disappoint . not the burrito <unk> i use to know . price are way up now too thank to minimum <unk> .
i have seen thi place so mani time , and i alway wonder about it as i love a good chicken <unk> but i never decid to drop in as it 's alway dure the day when i drive <unk> when i decid to tri it i discov they have <unk> hour ! they are onli open dure the day ... <unk> , <unk> ? but they do veri good busi . so i tri it for lunch one day and i have been hook on it ever sinc , the chicken is alway good , never overcook and the rice is so delici ! when i 'm in the area i alway tri to stop in for some chicken <unk> !
<unk> is a bad employe for az <unk> . i close my account today becaus she think it 's funni that the bank charg us $ 35 when i do n't think it 's funni . i will never do busi again with them .
we had thi poutin with meat and mushroom over it . i want more gravi though . it wa n't the salti mess you get at new york fri , but i expect all the stuff on the fri to realli add a littl bit more flavor than what i tast . but i did eat their <unk> name <unk> burger . montreal 's <unk> with meat <unk> than what i usual find in other restaur . the burger are serv on a nice <unk> bun with pickl , a nice leaf of lettuc , and a <unk> <unk> through the middl . satisfi , and a fun , <unk> atmospher .
i wa unexpectedli disappoint with thi restaur . be a thoma <unk> restaur , i expect great thing , but instead had one of the worst meal of my two week vacat . you could say it wa just my meal , but my husband wa sub-par as well , the bread wa tough , and the servic wa veri slow and inattent . i made a mistak of not go with a `` classic '' french meal , but the <unk> with short rib <unk> sound interest , so i decid to tri it . i liter felt like i wa eat one step up from dog food . i 'm almost certain the kitchen had some leftov short rib dish that they <unk> , ad way too much oil , and threw it on top of some broken up , leftov pasta . <unk> ! it ha alway been a dream of mine to eat at the french <unk> , so i wa excit to tri one of thoma <unk> 's restaur . for a chef as <unk> as he is , he should realli pay more attent to the qualiti of hi restaur or els it is go to <unk> hi reput . i would never recommend someon to tri thi restaur in la vega when there are so mani other option out there .
the <unk> buffalo is my favorit barber shop in <unk> . i get my haircut the irish way ... sip on a <unk> ! awesom stylist and cool neighborhood bar . arcad basketbal , music and <unk> are also fun to play , if you do n't have a reserv and <unk> .
love thi fanci burger place , eat here dure my compani parti time in vega . i love my chicken burger , season just right , it 's so juici and it melt in my mouth .
what more can i say other than , well , thi place is a blast . the frozen yogurt is excel , and the atmospher is fun . the main point here is the <unk> <unk> is differ than the `` standard ice cream '' or dessert stop . grant the concept of the self serv ice cream is n't necessarili new , <unk> <unk> doe it right . it 's a tad bit pricier than your averag ice cream stop , but it 's worth the chang . you 'll enjoy it !
i love thi place . when i want to get out and have a nice quiet place to hangout i go here . howev sometim it not alway quiet becaus of bad ass kid run around , but that the parent fault not the librari . sometim peopl dont control their kid and it can get a littl loud and annoy . the <unk> and furnitur are nice and comfort . there are plenti of tabl for studi and <unk> surf on your laptop .
wish i could give zero star ! ! ! the servic is horribl ! my husband and i are plan to purchas a travel <unk> but have no idea where to begin ... <unk> ? how mani peopl doe it sleep ? what are the differ featur ? the guy that wa show us the variou <unk> wa super rude . he rush through the inform as if we were keep him from someth els ! i believ he thought we were n't real custom ... . by the time we got to the 3rd <unk> to look at it i wa done and readi to leav ! i think hi name wa <unk> but whatev the case , he wa a total <unk> ! i refus to come back ! kick rock !
the staff is veri friendli and help but the food is too simpl . the french toast look good , and i realli appreci have sever <unk> option but i could have made my burrito at home for less money . my tabl mate realli enjoy their <unk> . there are also sever funni <unk> <unk> on the restaur decor .
... ok , ok i like it here now . mayb i just need to `` <unk> '' the tast or the food is actual better . the staff is still hit or miss , but the food is good so that is realli all that matter . i guess i can roll with the beverag <unk> includ onli befor dinner time or whatev it is . salad ingredi still somewhat <unk> . one thing that doe work in the favor of thi locat is the <unk> window to pick up <unk> order that have been call in .
even though we were <unk> and the salon wa veri busi , they were abl to accommod us . <unk> doe a fantast job with hi pedicur - there wa n't a singl part that i did n't enjoy . excel servic !
came out on their day off to take care of my car . discuss <unk> packag in advanc over the phone and kept to the agre upon price when they came out . call ahead of appoint to confirm , and warn me of 15 minut delay . were friendli and complet work in a time fashion . total happi with the custom servic and the job done . thank you ! !
first time custom and realli like my haircut . it wa fairli busi and i think they could use a wait list rather then the rememb who came in next system as it seem to caus some confus .
my bf and i came in becaus i wa crave <unk> 's pie and they had it on their menu . i admit that it wa close to <unk> which is an hour befor they close at <unk> ... <unk> we wait for about 5 minut befor we were seat sinc the bartend wa go to wait on us . that wa a littl odd to me ... but oh well . servic wa <unk> ... we were the onli patron in the restaur area and we seem to be a <unk> to them sinc they seem to be have a ball in the bar area . but i did n't feel like drink ... i want to eat sinc i had just gotten off of a 14 hour shift and wa starv . and if dine thi late wa not what they want to do they should not keep the restaur open . they should just keep the bar open . i would have given 1 star but the <unk> wa great so i have an extra star for hi servic . the food wa ... i have no other word ... but the food wa horribl . brussel sprout ... i normal love them ... and i did eat all of it ... as read abov i just got off a 14 hour shift and wa starv . so i ate it ... but it wa so burnt and bitter . <unk> then the <unk> 's pie ... wa cold . the mixtur insid wa <unk> instead of a creami meati fill . they did have a littl bit of mash potato on it <unk> the puff <unk> but that wa cold as well ... i would have complain but the attitud of the server wa as such that i did not want to wast my time say anyth . mayb if i had come at a differ time , the servic and the food would have been better . who know ? i see that other peopl had better servic and food then i did . but with the food that i tast and the servic that i receiv will not have me rush back which is a shame sinc they are just down the street from me .
i have been on the high roller twice now . onc with a friend at night and onc dure the day with my husband . got lucki both time , they were not crowd . go at night is a treat . see the light of vega is alway beauti against the black <unk> of the desert . the onli bad thing is that the observ wheel is behind a lot of the casino , so you ca n't see all the way down the strip . i also enjoy see the view dure the day . la vega is in a valley and on a clear day you can see the beauti red rock format around the citi . we were also fortun to catch the <unk> . the ride take about 30 minut , but that is long enough . they have a <unk> with an open bar that you can pay extra for , but you onli have <unk> minut to slam them drink down ! person , i am more interest in the view . the wheel is good to do onc or twice , but not habit form . i think it is a littl pricey , but everyth in la vega ha gone up . it is $ <unk> for adult at night and $ <unk> for the day without the bar . they did have a summer special for local - two for one tuesday . check to see if they are still offer thi great save befor you go . have fun !
talk about atmospher , thi place realli ha it all ! everi time i walk in i see someth new that i miss the last time and the drink are amaz . who knew that one place could have so mani cool featur and so much awesom in one place ? i 'll definit be back here again and again !
dirti dive <unk> rock bar just off the strip . great <unk> full of <unk> classic . <unk> pinbal machin , interest <unk> local , lot of smell , and cheap drink . they have a bacon martini , which is amaz . it tast like cold bacon . be warn though , it will fuck you up . the best part of thi place is see peopl wander in off the strip , take one look around , and walk out . some feel oblig , to order one drink , <unk> sip it , and then leav . you should stare at them .
came to thi place for dinner , the servic wa realli bad , food wa nasti had a realli bad stomach <unk> after . do not recommend thi place at all ! ! !
thi is my first time to <unk> . i use to live in <unk> hill and saw thi restaur be built but never had a chanc to eat here . i came to visit my boyfriend in <unk> hill and he recommend us to eat here . from the outsid the restaur doe n't look like a great place to eat . howev the <unk> decor is veri modern . onc you enter the restaur there 's a takeout station . we seat ourselv . the tabl at the restaur are veri privat which i like . there 's a <unk> at each tabl if you need the waitress for water , the bill or anyth els . we order the <unk> <unk> dip to share and it came with unlimit help of fresh homemad <unk> bread sooo yummi . when you ask for refil on the bread the server would give you attitud . she end up not bring us the bread refil after we ask for it so we did n't ask again . whi offer unlimit bread when you get <unk> off when the custom ask for it ? ! that 's whi one star wa <unk> from thi restaur . other than the rude servic . the food i have to say wa amaz ! the meat wa tender and the chicken wa super season and juici . when order the beef order medium . i order medium well and it came too well done . i would come back again but hope i get anoth wait staff that 's not so rude . the lunch special wa a bit pricey at $ <unk> but the qualiti of food wa great !
it 's a realli afford fun soda bar ! it ca n't do complex soda creation , like an egg cream , but they can do awesom pure . i would recommend tri simpl drink first , like coke and <unk> or <unk> , lemonad , and strawberri pure .
wave hous is a great compani . they did such a great job the first time i use them - i decid to have them come monthli and they have yet to do a bad job . <unk> is quick to respond if i have question and they are just nice peopl to work with . awesom compani - highli recommend !
we drove 20 minut and park in the <unk> mile and walk just for thi place . start off bad walk in with <unk> in a <unk> right by the door . not a fan as a vegan ... the hostess and waiter were nice . but they sat us at a tabl that wa all wet <unk> and did not clean it . my feet were wet from have <unk> . we order the load vegan nacho that were pretti good . they were n't as big as other order so we were a bit disappoint . then we order the chimichanga and a salad . the vegan `` chicken '' wa probabl the worst we 've had . it wa burnt , and tast like burnt dri chicken . not even with a nice flavor . <unk> they have someth call a <unk> shot which the tabl next to us were all have veri <unk> . eat littl <unk> . just becaus they have a vegan menu , they are not a good vegan friendli choic . with so mani other amaz option in vega , i would go elsewher . especi with the price .
came for dinner with my mom on a tuesday night without reserv and wait mayb about 10 minut befor be seat . red 8 is a nice place to eat that is n't too upscal or <unk> . there 's a lot of choic from dim sum , to variou noodl and rice dish and dumpl . red 8 serv pretti tasti chines food , better than some of the chines place at other hotel nearbi . my onli downfal to the place wa probabl the wait time for the food . i order a hot and sour soup , the portion wa quit <unk> i thought it wa quit delici but my mom thought it wa too salti . next we had what wa suppos to be the pork and shrimp <unk> i think they sent us pork dumpl ( i could n't tast ani shrimp in it ) . the dumpl were steam and were quit <unk> a bit rich , which is whi i wa want the shrimp and pork dumpl . it came in an order of 3 , so after me and my mom each had one , i felt bad let the waiter know the order wa wrong . we also order the beef <unk> fun ( in soy sauc ) to share . thi wa quit a larg and fill portion with nice size piec of beef . lastli we had the vegan tofu <unk> . piec of tofu , veggi and <unk> mushroom , exactli what i wa crave for . everyth wa pretti good , i 'm usual not a fan of chines food , but i thought that red 8 had good varieti , ambianc and chines fare .
locat in <unk> <unk> citi in the mgm grand . basic , you go in to screen a tv show and give your feedback . in return , you get an <unk> full of coupon ( <unk> cafe , <unk> 's hot dog , <unk> , <unk> citi retail store , <unk> ) . not a bad way to spend an hour . it 's air condit and it 's free . the boy ( 15 and 18 ) had a great time .
<unk> in and out for guy . rememb my cut style everi time
onc again i am wow by thi place . the wine for starter wa amaz . but just when i though it could not get ani better than the ribey dri age for 3 month i am hit with someth extra special . the <unk> steak . bone in ny strip . i know what your think . i have had those . but tri one dri age for 9 month . ye 9 month . unbeliev . not to mention the truffl pasta and even the kale salad wa someth special . truli the best steak anywher and the atmospher and servic is fantast . <unk> <unk> is a <unk> . i am onc again remind whi thi is a must everi time i am in vega .
cute place . i onli tri the cake pop , which were absolut delici . fun as vegan have access to delici bake good for special occas .
have no idea whi thi place doe n't have a higher rate . the food is excel ; pad thai wa spot on and oh so authent . i ate it two day in a row , want three , but no time . the lobster ginger wa so tasti , perfectli cook and <unk> . <unk> our server wa nice , she wa accommod . definit go back . definit recommend . the best pad thai around . the person next tabl over wa have green curri and the smell wa just so <unk> ; exactli how green curri should <unk> <unk> , sweet and salti .
again i have to say that sometim a situat come down to good or bad custom servic , and i must say we experienc the bad . is the hotel clean ? ye . were the bed comfort ? they were okay . did the bathroom have two sink ? ye , thank you god ! but the problem i 'm find in a lot of hotel recent is no <unk> light in the shower area . onc you close the shower <unk> it 's complet dark . forget about shave without cut yourself ladi ! plu , the tub wa super <unk> . glad i did n't break a foot for the third time ( long stori ... ) . but , when it came to deal with the front desk girl , it wa not such a pleasant experi . we were stay here for a wed in their larg <unk> facil . there wa no <unk> on the invit of what <unk> it wa in , so i ask the girl at the front desk . she simpli said `` i do n't know . '' how do you not know what 's go on in the hotel you work at ? ? ? we were walk around with a 90 year old woman , and she told is to just follow the long hallway back and it `` should '' be there . well , that wa n't the case . come to find out by some nicer hotel employe it wa in the build next door . when i went back to tell her she wa wrong , and to give her the head up becaus more peopl would probabl ask her , she just said , `` yeah , it 's the build next door . '' no apolog . so i told her she should know where the event is in case other ask . she just shot me a <unk> look and <unk> her shoulder . not cool . so while the hotel wa clean and perfectli accept for a night , the servic left much to be desir .
<unk> and in attent servic . you could tell the waitress hate serv a group . food wa mediocr .
i 'm glad they remov the <unk> 18 % <unk> cost that everyon complain about in the review below . when the boyfriend and i decid to go , we took the recommend of a few review that said it wa a lot of food - plu , spend $ 100 for two peopl on tea just seem ridicul - so we did one tea set for 2 peopl . we both <unk> with thi howev , and feel like it is not a lot of food and it would have been fine for each of us to get our own tea order . i appreci the fact that they did the vegetarian version no problem . i notic other peopl had differ dessert than us ... though , i ca n't imagin the dessert were n't vegetarian , so i wa confus on whi we were the onli one with the dessert that we got . i 'm think it 's random on who get what but not sure . we had a health tea i ca n't rememb but it wa <unk> and <unk> . it wa veri veri good ! they had a <unk> oliv thing on a plastic spoon and were call those the vegetarian `` sandwich '' - what ? we paid $ <unk> for the tea with tax and tip appropri . no problem with the actual server like some of the other review mention . but i ca n't get over the price point on thi one , especi when it is in the lobbi and just doe n't seem as fanci as high tea should be . just my opinion . for what you pay i do not think it 's worth it , but i read lot of review on here where peopl said it wa . i took star off for locat of where they decid to put thi tea , lack of valu for your money , and less fanci than i thought it would be ( we were onli one dress up ) . we ask for a window seat but did not get one . we did n't want to go to the window to take a look becaus there 's other peopl sit right in front so i felt it would be rude to stand in front of them . i felt like i could n't get the best experi becaus of thi . one thing that just <unk> me off and definit deserv a star off is the fact there 's no self park at <unk> orient . you have to valet for $ 20 ( plu tip <unk> ) and you onli get your park valid if you spend $ 100 . we park at <unk> <unk> shop for $ 12 and walk . still a hassl , and for what you pay here you should n't have to go through all thi troubl to get to the place and be forc to valet ! now , we did have a good time , but just not sure if i would come here again .
veri good food , the garlic naan bread is quit nice . butter chicken alway is my favor .
all of my friend recommend thi place for the ramen and it did not disappoint ! the ramen wa realli flavor and just the right amount of salt for me . noodl were not too soggi and the pork belli wa amaz ! there wa a light crunch to the pork belli edg the staff were realli friendli and our <unk> share some of their favorit . end up go with the <unk> king crab . it wa such a sweet and light addit to our meal , veri differ from savori crab dish . <unk> : cherri milk punch ! ! it 's good if you like sour type of alcohol . our bartend wa kind enough to explain how our drink is made and ye if you 're <unk> intoler do n't get thi drink becaus there is milk in it despit not be abl to see it ( see pictur ) . lastli dessert . we got the birthday cake slice from the milk bar connect to <unk> . it wa sweet and the cereal tast to it made it veri differ than your averag <unk> cake ! <unk> <unk> all around !

it 's a shame thi hotel doe n't have more review etc . probabl becaus it is a hidden gem of sort . thi hotel is locat just a few block away from the veri live <unk> st. <unk> so it 's ideal in that it 's nice and peac in the area around the hotel but one can walk to <unk> in less than 5 minut . the room were atleast twice the size of a hotel you might <unk> in a new york citi or san francisco , and at half the price . my room wa a suit style room , although i did n't avail of the amen in the room it wa nice to know that these were avail . the servic wa of particular note at thi hotel . one got the feel that the front desk staff are veri talent , knowledg and skill in interact with guest . they were amazingli polit and person . i had one of the member pull out a map and draw a walk <unk> through downtown montreal which i did take . it wa good to see the staff take that much pride in present inform about thi great citi . afford price , great locat , peac , quiet with a great staff , would definit recommend thi hotel
thi hipster coffe shop should not put anyon off . coffe wa excel ! the lemon cake wa a morn favorit as well . it 's worth the wait if you see a long line , which move quick anyway . from the chill dj beat to the great mix of young , old , artist , busi person . thi coffe shop wa a gem in down town .
thi rate is long <unk> . i use to work at a differ locat so i know the qualiti of the food and the work that goe into the prep . i come to thi locat for the great servic , chicken finger , steak special ( breakfast is onli <unk> ) , the chicken fri chicken and <unk> mimosa . ca n't go wrong with an <unk> island draft either .
okay so if you 're in need of a <unk> for all 36 of your cousin and you realli do n't feel like put ani effort into it - thi is your place . there is e v e r y t <unk> i n g you can imagin here , and it all say la vega . there are <unk> top , stuf anim , <unk> , <unk> , toy , cup , <unk> , serious everyth . the price are low , the option are high . there are also a ton of park spot , which is alway a bonu . it doe need a bit of updat , though .
sorri to report thi locat is close it door . ill send a pictur with the sign . thi wa a great place will be sad to see it go it been a stapl place of wonder food for year . mani memori were made here .
the onli reason i stay here wa becaus i had it pick on <unk> . lot of secret up charg as <unk> at the individu who the hotel is name after . room are decent . not clean as someon 's <unk> wa on the window as they <unk> had sex
1st and <unk> i should say i am not a <unk> . i do not danc at all but my boyfriend want us to go to a club to listen to some good music . my boyfriend got us on a list here through `` no cover night club '' . neither one of us had to pay a cover and it wa open bar till 12 or someth for women . so that part wa realli nice . free entri and sever free drink . what i hate is the fact that there is <unk> that we saw where i could sit and man did my feet hurt ! we did n't stay long due to thi . onli <unk> with bottl servic get to sit . wa kind of cool to see the girl danc in the thing behind the bar .
i came here on the recommend of a friend . she told me who doe her pedicur so i person came in and made an appoint but that person did not do my nail , when i ask about it at my appoint i wa told she no longer work there . pretti shadi if you ask me . not the best , not the worst pedicur .

good food , make sure to order hummu with shawarma . ok so we were parti of 8 order our meal that came in separ time also few of the order were cold ( i guess the food wa sit while the server wa busi . busi ? busi do what ? the restaur wa half empti . we want to drink water so we had to mention it few time befor we actual got water , need more pita , same problem we had to mention it few time befor it wa serv cold . a bit prici for the portion , they need to adjust their price about % 20 less then their current price . also they ad % 18 servic fee on the total . had to mention the free sangria also twice befor we got it . few posit thing about thi place is that there is plenti of park , good food , nice clean place , larg place and you feel that you 're in a real restaur . overal not too bad , will be better with the live band at night .
do not order out from here . it is alway over an hour from the time you call . thi place is get wors everi time we go . <unk> in <unk> is twice as far but at thi point worth the drive .
thi place is close enough to one of my base in town to be abl to order <unk> and save the deliveri fee , which is onli a coupl buck if you 're feel <unk> but they add an addit charg if you onli order a small pizza . the pizza is n't bad , but it 's not outstand either . the top are usual decent , but we 've had issu with them throw <unk> <unk> onto our pizza and <unk> it when we call them about it later and tri to <unk> us that it 's not an issu . a small pizza with 2-3 top can wind up cost you between $ <unk> plu the deliveri fee . the custom servic can be <unk> . we 've been made to wait while the owner talk to one of the employe and our pizza sat behind the counter get cold . the photo of the owner with celebr post on the wall are <unk> <unk> ( and badli ) .
overal good place but honestli they take forev and over charg all the time ... plu it 's alway pack
the insid of the place look like a <unk> taco bell , i wa realli disappoint with the layout and feel of the place sinc it is a <unk> own restaur . the nacho were terribl and made my husband sick , but i got the carn asada taco and they were realli good and i wa fine later . we also had ton of food we would n't normal eat and drank a lot more than usual . ( i think it final caught up with him and made hi stomach hurt ) i order guacamol and chip as a side and it wa so good . i wa n't abl to eat even half of it , but i wish we had one close by just so i could get the guacamol .

i 've been here for almost a year , and i ca n't wait until my leas is up and get out of here . manag doe n't seem to care about good tenant problem , and the offic staff ha 2 good agent <unk> rich and jeff . the rest of the offic staff are horribl . one start to wonder if they allow just about anyon to move in here . of cours there are great , friendli neighbor , but seem to be more bad than good . reason i 'm give 3 star is becaus they are pet friendli and the surround ( the neighborhood ) is beauti . i do n't recommend thi place if you 're tri to live in a safe and peac complex . i truli hope they start take complaint and tenant satisfact more seriou , i 'd happili <unk> , just wo n't hold my breath .
decent ayc sushi . the staff were veri friendli , the <unk> and <unk> were top notch , and the roll were plenti and vari . <unk> one point for the slight <unk> of <unk> . they also had a vinegar base sauc on a few roll that did n't impress , but beyond that , all wa excel . good price , too .
what use to be a madison tradit for colleg student and those look for a fun <unk> place ha becom an <unk> dump . i went there last sunday with my wife to watch some <unk> on their big screen upstair , and boy did it not take long to make us leav . for starter , we went to the bar upstair to order some drink and food , onli to have the bartend be fairli rude and <unk> when we ask question . he look like a normal <unk> guy , but appar he must have been <unk> or someth becaus he just did n't want to provid ani kind of servic what so ever . after pay for the food , my wife went back up to ask if they put a charg hold on the card becaus she rememb thi from her time at colleg there , and it turn out they did . i had no idea about thi , and the bartend never mention it befor i paid . so it turn out , they put a charg on your card for <unk> dollar if you pay for anyth with it . the reason is to `` make sure you have money in your account '' . it 's now four day later , and that charg is still sit on my bank account , tie up money i could have use for other thing . dure thi whole process , i wa obvious a bit upset but i wa calm about it becaus we want to just watch the game and have a good time . sadli , the volum on their speaker wa set for rave level , and i wa go <unk> from the nois level rather than be abl to have a convers and watch the game . there were liter five peopl in the place , so i do n't understand what they were gear up for . one of the big tv wa on <unk> while the other one wa on the game , so i went up and ask if they could chang it to one of the other <unk> game that wa on . the bartend said it 's go to happen ( again <unk> ) , and eventu chang it to a game . we final got our food . what use to be some of the best madison chees curd are now some over process orang heap of <unk> bad . my burger look like it had come out of a <unk> <unk> machin . neither of the item tast ani better . got up and left at thi point , wo n't be back again unless i 'm realli realli realli drunk . which , grant , is probabl the onli time it 's worth patron thi pile of an establish .
servic wa <unk> and food mediocr . use to be a great place to go for a special dinner . what happen ?
super slow . 7 custom and all wait in line for about 20 to 30 min . do t know if it wa the manag but the 2 ladi 's in the back talk the phone
i wa 6 yr old when my parent bought me my first <unk> `` <unk> . '' if you 're a fan of michael <unk> 's most memor hit , then thi show is for you ! they play ca n't stop love you , beat it , <unk> , smooth <unk> , scream , and mani more . the `` chase the glove '' part wa not necessari as i wa complet entertain thru out the entir show . my 6 and <unk> old enjoy the charact run around and act silli becaus they had no idea who michael <unk> wa ! seat are great wherev you sit in section <unk> . there were speaker in the head rest which wa veri loud . <unk> brought over extra <unk> for the children for better <unk> ( i did n't even ask for thi ! ! ) but a great plu ! <unk> tech peopl did an awesom job ! the light show from `` beat it '' wa superb ! paid $ 900 for 4 ticket in section <unk> row <unk> we enjoy popcorn and 2 <unk> for 25 buck . i chose to withdraw 1 star for lack of trick . ye there were a few acrobat from the ceil , guy balanc on a rope , 1 guy danc with onli 1 leg , but it wa still lack that bag of trick at the end for a grand final ! well done vega , ye i would see it again ! i cri , laugh , said wow a few time , and left feel like michael <unk> actual meant someth to my <unk> .

thi place is awesom ! i 've driven by quit a few time and alway rememb it 's there onc i am past the center . i 've been mean to stop in for quit awhil now , and final made it in today . it 's rather larg , and everyth is veri well organ . there are <unk> , <unk> , sport equip , cloth of all size and style , and furnitur . there is also a room dedic to <unk> 's , which is probabl the most organ i 've ever seen at a <unk> store . i am not sure whi anyon would say that thi place is over price . that could n't be further from the truth . we found everyth to be reason , and they <unk> thing even further as the week goe on ( today the blue tag were 50 % off and the black tag were 75 % off ) . they also offer 40 % off to those with a valid militari id on monday and a senior discount for those over the age of <unk> on wednesday . i discov today that the staff are all volunt , which is awesom , becaus you know that the money from sale is go to the caus , not to <unk> from pay employe . the sale are also all <unk> , sinc thi place it a <unk> organ . they are associ with central christian church , so some profit go there to help the food bank , and other provid <unk> and work train to those in <unk> . there were lot of great item , of good qualiti and we found a few thing to buy . both my mom and i decid that it wa the nicest , most organ <unk> store we had been to in quit awhil .
book the place . they put us on the last room befor they remodel entir hotel . find out the last day . wa n't pleasant experi
have to agre , what start off as realli great turn into a nightmar and glad we no longer live in thi shit hole . first off the staff , chri and <unk> were great and realli got thing done , the new peopl are lazi and <unk> . <unk> , the short mexican is lazi , rude and doe n't understand the <unk> of a smile . to say thi for is downright unpleas is give her too much credit . the ground are decent enough thank to the actual hard work mainten crew , the nois level start off good until they allow peopl <unk> colleg kid who do not know what quiet hour mean . parti until <unk> am on a weekday . when explain to offic staff who alreadi doe n't do ani work , they do n't do anyth about it . liter said there is noth we can do . how about your job ? nope ! noth is down ! get in your rent in just one day late becaus you work for a live and could n't make it in you have to pay an addit $ 160 late fee ! again one day late ! to say i would recommend thi place would say i recommend have all your <unk> teeth pull while have a <unk> done . stay away from thi <unk> ! !
first time go to get my <unk> <unk> . went to mr <unk> he wa super <unk> and friendli , made everyth fast and clean . would give a higher rate but i 'm not 100 % on the <unk> of one but if i do decid i do n't like it <unk> will <unk> do me for free ... . other than that if i do need ani other piec i will return

stop by <unk> to visit the boy and took him for a long <unk> haircut . we wait about 10 minut and the haircut did the trick .
if i could give it less than one star , i would . the place is horribl . we stood and wait for the hostess while she wa chat . her pant were too small as wa her top and she had to keep pull her pant up . i thought that i wa in a strip joint , she had so much skin show between her pant and top . we final got seat . on a saturday morn , there were onli about <unk> tabl with peopl . they were small group of two , besid . anyway , when we final got to order , we wait 35 minut for our food to come out ! the hash brown were <unk> and in a <unk> of oil . the coffe wa nasti . the food is just aw . there is absolut noth that could get me to go back .
they look after their wine - keep them in excel condit with <unk> <unk> , and they have some excel thing to tri . ye , i know that 's what you 'd expect from a wine bar ... but they were much better than most that i 've tri over the year . an interest tapa style menu , beauti prepar .
thi place is n't alway bad , but when it 's bad , it 's realli bad . tonight we order pizza and wing . the wing had the wrong sauc , but were accept . but the pizza wa so soggi that even the box had lost it integr . we threw <unk> piec away .
walk in from <unk> az into a dimli lit pub . a rather larg pub . great ambianc and atmospher with friendli servic and almost a <unk> of the past . the pie have a heavi skin with a nice crust . the fill are rich and bold in flavor . scotch egg wa perfectli cook and flavor with a great crust . perfectli chill <unk> to bring it all togeth . seem like there wa onli 1 friendli server for about 10 tabl . thi did slow thing down a bit but overal happi here and will be back to tri more of their menu .
half order <unk> ( for the win ) i love thi place even more now becaus i just discov they let you order half size for the fatti that ca n't decid between two order ! lol instead of 4 egg omelett a you can request 2 egg which is what i did with my mexican omelett . <unk> smart ! mexican omelett : <unk> realli cheesi and good ! <unk> of sour cream on top went good with the red enchilada sauc and jalapeño . island dish : <unk> hawaiian dish <unk> sausag <unk> with two egg ( we got over easi ) and scoop of rice . the flavor of the sausag wa delici salti ! banana pancak : <unk> wow . the banana were sweet and the pancak fluffi ! damn good . i got a side of thi and it wa my perfect dessert . banana nut muffin : <unk> free when you check-in on yelp ! thank you for the delici food and for the awesom servic ! 5 star everyth !
everyon at thi locat is veri attent and polit . i <unk> like the wood decor and the modern way the restaur is design . the food wa veri good . the <unk> <unk> are larg and worth way more . i got the sushi <unk> and that wa tasti as well . the dress ha a bit of hot spice that wa just ok . the main reason i am give 4 star is that the music wa realli loud especi for a lunch crowd . it made it hard to talk to the other peopl at the tabl . in the restroom it wa twice as loud . five star if they can turn it down a bit .
absolut best mexican food in the valley . if you do n't know authent mexican food then you wo n't like thi place but if you do thi place will never let you down . fantast salsa with chip made on the spot . <unk> ( the owner ) alway greet us and say hello . if he doe n't see us come in he will make a point to come by and say hello befor we leav . could n't say enough great thing about thi place !
realli want thi place to be a winner . we tri thi place twice <unk> thi is our 3rd time . never wrote review <unk> we hope we were just experienc one of their `` off day '' . reason for my rate : too inconsist and doe n't tast like `` soul '' food . we order a full <unk> of rib twice - receiv <unk> 8 rib both time . for those that know about rib , know how mani is a <unk> ... not sure what they 're do but either way i should at least get 10 rib ... do n't just complet <unk> my <unk> ! the rib are either tender and meati on some day or fatti and chewi on other . i do n't like the inconsist . um next , the corn <unk> it cri for milk and sugar <unk> like airi <unk> and water ... potato <unk> the first time wa pretti <unk> which is whi we order it for the 2nd time but it wa too <unk> . then order again for a 3rd time just to make sure the 2nd time wa n't a mistak and it again wa too <unk> . i 'm talk too <unk> like i had to chop 1 piec of a potato into 3 smaller piec . which one is it , <unk> or <unk> ? the mac and chees tast like like a doctor up box of <unk> mac and chees . again thi food is <unk> under `` soul food '' . mayb sell grill steak and burger and becom an all american restaur <unk> your side are n't good . you ca n't call it soul food just becaus you sell mac and chees , <unk> green and corn bread . soul food is apart of <unk> just like <unk> or asian cuisin . soul food might be the wrong <unk> for thi one or at least my soul think so
delici pho ! broth is amaz and servic is so friendli . i recommend thi restaur and can not wait to eat here again .
i am not one for go out of my way to visit a doctor let alon a dental offic . it ha been a veri long time sinc my last clean and my old dentist wa n't that great . i could n't stand the smell and the attitud i wa given . a friend of mine goe to <unk> modern <unk> and told me i should give them a tri . my mouth wa hurt and i did n't want to go to the dentist offic ( but let 's be real , who realli doe right ? ) ani who ; as soon as i walk in , the front offic wa veri pleasant and wa n't at all mean , ( like other offic ) , the assist are veri pleasant , and dr <unk> is excel ! also , the ladi who clean my teeth , <unk> , did a great job and explain everi procedur she wa do . she made my dental experi one of a kind and i will definit be back . ( next step , brace ! )
thi place is amaz . they gave everyth you need meat <unk> . i look forward to the <unk> <unk>
ok , do n't do a lot of five star rate here . the experi must be complet . from park to pay my bill . so far , <unk> smoke barbecu ha hit all the mark . now , we had their nacho with the brisket . outstand . great flavor , the chees is authent and the <unk> barbecu sauc on the side is flavor . we went upstair to tri out a few beverag and a littl bit of eat . mark is the bartend up there and he is everybodi 's friend . a rare talent . the atmospher is great especi with the balconi look out onto la vega <unk> . and the gold and silver pawn store <unk> . i would recommend thi to anyon . oh , by the way , if anyon is wonder , i wa not <unk> to do thi .
the food wa excel but slow in come . after four cup of delici coffe you know it 's slow . we went on a $ 40 groupon that they would not honor . even though our meal wa over $ 40 . at first he said the manag that we need to have had a fourth meal . <unk> could we find thi . except that it wa for four and we went over the $ 40 . he did give us credit for what we paid origin . anyway it wa differ but the groupon made the experi bad .
horribl place and by far the worst salon experi to date . i went there to get my hair <unk> . i show the <unk> a pictur of what i want . it did n't have to be exact , but i wa expect someth <unk> boy wa i ever wrong . instead of the blond <unk> <unk> i want , i got an orang <unk> on the tip of my hair . not onli wa the `` blond '' an actual hideou orang but my hair wa fri , done . took me 2 year to grow the <unk> , damag hair out . pretti sure she just <unk> bleach on my head and did n't take into account that i have veri fine hair which mean it bleach faster than ani other hair type . best of all , the stylist did not even blow dri my hair . i could bare see what thi look like until i got home . i paid $ 200 for a mess of a <unk> job that i probabl could have done better at home and to leav the salon with wet hair . worst salon ever ! ! ! ! ! ! i went to anoth salon 2 day after to fix my hair ( after my .. '' <unk> '' ... i do n't think you can even call it hair ) . would not recommend unless you want your hair ruin for a coupl year .
well it 's clear that i need to check out what peopl have to say on yelp befor i use a servic like <unk> tour . if i had taken the two second requir to read these review , i never would have use them ! my experi wa veri similar to what mani other peopl experienc . i wa stay at planet hollywood with some cowork for a confer , our flight wa for 7pm on friday night . so the shuttl schedul a <unk> for 5pm . plenti of time , right ? well not when the shuttl doe n't show up until <unk> ! ! it wa a veri stress <unk> needless to say . the save grace wa our friendli and apologet driver . i wish i had gotten hi name , he wa <unk> onli good part about thi whole experi , and onli becaus he own up to how late he wa . i hate to give neg review but unfortun <unk> tour deserv one .
thi review is <unk> for the la vega suit properti manag compani and not the mgm signatur suit hotel . la vega suit manag certain room in thi hotel and we had the <unk> of stay in one of them on our recent trip to vega . stay in a room manag by lv is a much differ experi than stay in a room that 's actual part of the mgm hotel . the reason we book thi stay to begin with wa becaus we had stay here previous and had a great experi , but we stay in an mgm manag suit . thi time , i book the room through <unk> and did n't pay attent the small print when i paid for the room ( doe anyon realli look at that stuff ? ) big mistak on my part . upon check into the hotel we immedi notic a few thing that were instantli differ from our last stay . first of all , when i made the room reserv , i specif state through <unk> that we want a room on a high floor away from the elev . my wife and i are veri <unk> to nois and , have travel extens , know that room near the elev tend to be the <unk> so we want to be as far away as we could . the front desk person told us that not onli had they book us right next to the elev , but we were overlook the pool which ha a danc parti everi day from 11am - 5pm . she did n't think it would be a big deal though as the room wa still not veri close to the elev door and you could n't hear the music from the parti with the balconi door close . we ask to switch our room , but she said sinc we had book through lv we had to contact them and they would n't be open until tomorrow . when we got into the room we instantli saw sever thing <unk> : 1 ) the room featur a guest bathroom with a shower stall which my kid were go to use sinc they were sleep in the live room . the floor of the shower wa filthi with black dirt <unk> left over from who know how long ago ( see pictur ) 2 ) the sofa bed mattress that my kid were go to be sleep on had huge hole and <unk> on the bottom that look like <unk> had been <unk> on ( see pictur ) 3 ) the <unk> phone in the live room did n't work at all 4 ) there were stain on the live room carpet <unk> the coffe tabl ( see pictur ) 5 ) furnitur in the unit had hole or <unk> sign of wear ( see pictur ) 6 ) the outsid balconi wa filthi and look like the glass had not been clean in some time ( see pictur ) 7 ) not onli did they put us in a room that wa overlook the pool parti , but we were directli <unk> to a construct site that start work everi morn at <unk> ( see pictur and video ) now , i understand that hotel ca n't <unk> when construct is go to be go on next to their properti , but you would think that someon schedul the room would look at our request and think , `` <unk> these peopl do n't want to be near the elev - they probabl would like a room in the quiet part of the hotel . '' i serious do n't think anyon actual look at those special room request anyway so it wa probabl just wish think on my part . there wa also a sign in the room that wa essenti a menu for clean servic . if we want to have the room clean on a daili basi it would be $ 50 , if we want clean towel it would $ 20 - ye , that 's right $ 20 for clean towel . i consid us lucki that they grant us an extra roll of toilet paper in our unit . who know how much extra that would have cost ? i did see in the small print on our <unk> that there would be a $ 50 clean fee base on the size of the unit , but again , i 've never stay in a `` hotel '' that charg for clean so i did n't pay ani attent to it . i guess that 's the last time i skip the fine print . when i tri to call lv the next day i spoke to a fairli rude woman on the phone who told me that she wa sorri , but they were fulli <unk> and could n't move our room and sinc no special request had been made for a quiet room they could n't make ani <unk> for us . i ask if her if there wa anyth they could do as far as mayb give us a discount or a food and beverag credit and she flat our refus . basic , what we learn is that when you stay in a suit that 's manag by lv you are complet on your own . we even tri call down to the front desk for a pair of <unk> one night and were told that sinc we were not hotel guest they could n't provid us with one . if you are look to stay at the signatur suit do yourself a favor and book directli through the hotel . la vega suit is a sorri excus for a compani that onli care about their bottom line and could n't give a <unk> ass what their custom think . oh , and <unk> <unk> , do n't bother write a <unk> respons to my review as you have done with everyon els . it just make you and your compani look <unk> and <unk> to cover up your fault rather than tri to <unk> an extrem <unk> custom .
i live in la vega so i go to <unk> . charleston a lot in the summer sinc it is 20 degre cooler , and in the winter you have snow that you can enjoy and get back home in a jiffi ! i stay at the resort and i had a fantast time , i got the coupon in my <unk> coupon ! it wa so fun , we arriv got settl in , we had a small balconi just right for the two of us ! the room are kinda <unk> theme , if you want <unk> there is plenti of that on the strip . we then went on a small walk with the snow settl on the ground , it wa refresh and beauti ! we return ha dinner and had a drink at the loung , what a nice atmospher . thi is a great <unk> , for us on a budget ... so close and so differ from the desert ! love it !
a bit disappoint . thought thi would be a cool place with lot of seat and a loung vibe . arriv and realiz it wa tini and <unk> - it 's just a <unk> taco bell done up vega style that serv alcohol mix drink . bf and i walk in , look around , said to each other `` that 's it ? ! `` , then left to go <unk> out somewher els . the place is decor in loung style , dim with color light , music <unk> <unk> . have to admit it look kind of cool . size <unk> , it 's <unk> . liter like , a littl corner shop tuck away on strip . we walk by and miss it the first time . it get crowd line up wait to order , merchandis stand take up space . <unk> seat both insid and outsid . noth realli special here , save your time in vega and go somewher more uniqu and fun ! bf and i love taco bell , but we were n't too impress . wo n't be back !
one of my favorit restaur in madison . the onli complaint i have is that we did n't know you could request to be by the window . we 've request it befor , but they told us we could n't . when we came , they said the window were complet book for the night . we were just confus on the process for get a window . we did wait an hour and got a window and the food and servic were good . still one of my favorit place in madison .
you pretti much alreadi know what you 're go to get with a fast food place , decent servic and accept food with a killer amount of <unk> . pro : the place is clean , plenti of park , cheap . con : servic is random , had great and horribl servic . gener notic they do n't handl rush well . no avail drink machin so you have to go back up front and they wast anoth cup on each refil . <unk> level in the food are ridicul , have to plan your meal or you 'll hit <unk> easi . meh : music is non <unk> , food qualiti is accept , traffic is n't that bad to get in and out .
closest thing to real <unk> bbq i 've ever had in thi citi . i 'll be back again . whole <unk> eastern north carolina style with white slaw , or you can get the red slaw and dress that with <unk> style dip .
the food , drink and servic are great . the one thing hold thi place back is that it 's way too loud . they had a dj play best of the 80 crap at ear ring volum . server could bare hear our order , convers wa a shout match . the coupl next to us left becaus of it . a tabl next to us move and had all of their food shift to a tabl near the front becaus they could n't take it . the food here is fantast but would rather opt for take out than to return . it 's that ridicul . crazi fun fact : we went to see a metal band play across the street at <unk> after . we both agre that the metal show wa n't as loud as the stupid dj at dinner . there 's your refer point . it 's <unk> than be at a metal show . what a shame .
omg . i wish i found thi way sooner befor i start my diet . my husband and i ate at thai noodl hous and wa look for someth sweet to end our dinner . we walk over and tri thi place for the first <unk> wa the best thing ever ! ! ! i had the white chocol <unk> cooki with the pistachio ice cream which are two of my favorit . i wa n't too sure if they were gon na tast good togeth ... and it did . it wa the best thing i ever tast . will <unk> come back on one of my <unk> day for sure .
thi is a great car servic . i <unk> an onlin reserv for my boss and then had to call and updat them regard hi cancel then <unk> new flight that wa delay sever time due to bad weather . i ask that the driver stay at the airport to pick up my boss regardless of how long it took , and the <unk> <unk> that would happen . hi 7 pm flight end up arriv almost at midnight , and the driver wa there to take him to hi hotel . be three thousand mile away run a separ event , thi wa a huge benefit to me and of cours to my boss . i 'll be use peak limo again in the futur when one of my <unk> travel to charlott .
came here for a <unk> dure happi hour with a group i belong to . sinc it wa suggest by someon who happen to be a waitress here , my view of the excel servic we got may be a bit <unk> . but judg by the number of wait staff attend to diner on the patio , which wa pack by the time we left , i do n't think so . we sat insid , at the back pub tabl in the <unk> air condit . my drink buddi were take advantag of the happi hour price and <unk> <unk> , while i wa content to nurs my two glass of wine , one more than my usual . we were lucki to be at <unk> 's on tuesday , when burger are <unk> , so hubbi and i <unk> the appet and chew instead on some tasti burger . good qualiti . we 'll go back again ( thi wa , i think , our second visit ) , especi after learn about the good deal to be had with the pub dinner for $ <unk> . the burger wa excel , so i expect we 'll be happi the next time , too .
wa introduc to thi restaur . start off with the <unk> and tomato . noth special . should have order someth els . larg varieti of choic for entre . order the <unk> with babi <unk> . veri delici . i wa pleasantli surpris . dessert wa <unk> . veri good ! total bill wa not cheap but veri satisfi . will definit come back .

that may have been one of the best burger i 've ever had ! made perfectli to order and worth everi penni . i went in summer and it wa a full hous but not too full that i need to wait .

stop here for a quick lunch while pass through . sandwich wa a good size and had great flavor . fri were crunchi and servic wa fast and friendli . i would come by again .
what a nice room . the casino area is veri larg and veri vega like ... but one would think that it would be possibl to clean the air better so you do n't smell everyon that smoke . i have no problem with peopl smoke that is their busi . but i have to believ there is a way to clean the air better . you ca n't get to your room without walk through the casino . i felt like i smoke a pack a cigarett from the time i walk into the hotel until i got to the elev for the room . thi is realli a great place , the room are spectacular . great view ... just fix the smoke fill casino and thi would get 5 star ...
<unk> is a pretti cool place for some realli great food ! what a great local find in the area ! i actual found out about thi place via groupon . they had an offer for $ 10 for $ 20 and i love seafood and i love chicken so i bought it figur what did i have to lose ! ? well i must say i wa not disappoint ! when you walk in the door you come right up to the menu and counter and the cook are back there whip up amaz fish , shrimp and chicken dish right befor your eye ... <unk> that 's enough to make your mouth water ... <unk> it look so delici ! ! ! so we decid to tri a coupl of there top favorit , the staff wa veri help with their top <unk> and help make our decis much easier ! for starter we had the <unk> 's shrimp which are crispi fri shrimp toss with <unk> sauc and serv over cilantro slaw . the shrimp were cook until golden brown and then toss in to thi delici spici and sweet sauc that wa a perfect pair ... <unk> were soooo delici ! i almost wish we had a second order ! i chose the taco combo with the <unk> , shrimp and chicken ... .i figur i might as well tri all three so i could compar and have plenti of varieti ! there is no issu with portion size here ! all the taco are fill with the meat and slaw and a side of your choic ! the <unk> wa cook perfectli and full of flavor you could realli tast the differ spice they use to add extra flavor . the shrimp again were delici , and cover in a season blend and sauc mixtur ... .the onli thing i would add is some of the special signatur <unk> sauc ... that would have made these taco complet ! ! ! final the chicken wa realli good too ! veri tender and juici ! the taco came with a side and i chose the fri , they were hot and prepar well just lack season and crunch in my opinion . next time i would prefer a veget option . my boyfriend chose the salmon with the pineappl salsa top which ha pineappl , pepper and onion mix with a sweet and spici sauc . the salmon present wa beauti , i love the grill mark and the tast wa wonder , it wa flaki and tender and the sweet sauc ad a nice combin of flavor for the fish . for the side , he select the grill zucchini which wa sooo yummi ! ! ! again , got ta love those grill mark ! these are definit a must tri ! thi wa a great visit , i love food and the flavor the portion size and just everyth here wa great ! i look forward to come back !

go to a gun rang , learn about <unk> and shoot ha been on my <unk> list forev ! the entir experi from start to finish wa solid ! our driver <unk> pick my famili up from our hotel on time as schedul . he wa veri friendli , put my mind at eas and hi knowledg about not onli <unk> but colleg sport wa veri impress : ) <unk> wa our instructor and not know what to expect ( my emot rang from <unk> to beyond <unk> ) i can honestli tell you that i would not have been abl to complet my session had it not been for hi knowledg , patienc and assur that i got thi ! i plan on visit vega again but thi time specif to take shoot lesson with <unk> - thank guy !
thi is hand down the best pizza on the strip . you have got ta find thi place no matter what . all i will say is that place is locat in the <unk> hotel on the third floor where all the restaur are ! go find it and order the white pizza ! you will not regret it ! !
went in for a lunch bite . i got a <unk> taco and a <unk> taco . the meat wa season perfectli . my wife got the <unk> and pastor taco . the salsa at the salsa bar were right on point . the red wa spici , the green , my favorit , had a kick and excel flavor . we will be back .
just left <unk> and benni 's order a salad with chicken which said on <unk> wa $ 2 more pleas see photo , then order a <unk> with slaw . my bill came to <unk> , what a <unk> . last time i went here had a <unk> buy , same ladi behind the cash regist did not credit it , i paid $ 10 she charg me the rest , even though should have been $ <unk> had to take it in to her 3 week later and complain , she then credit my credit card . do not buy groupon to thi place , they will tri their best not to credit them . today , although they have great chicken tender , realli $ <unk> for six , a basic salad and small cole slaw wa a wast of time and money , will never return and urg you to see what you get for the money .
advertis as the best sushi in vega , i had to tri it , plu it wa close to the hotel . after read review on yelp , i knew that i wa go to order the sushi cupcak . their main thing is sushi burrito , but as i wa n't that hungri and the burrito look huge , i opt for the cupcak . the sushi cupcak come in a set of 4 . it come with 1 spici tuna , 2 crab and 1 smoke salmon . i chose to do 2 spici tuna and 2 crab . the cupcak are situat in a wonton <unk> which i did n't care for . the crab had sriracha , avocado and cream chees . the spici tuna had spici mayo , <unk> sauc and a cucumb . both were good and tast as you would expect for a fast food joint .
yum ! i got the <unk> smoothi with extra bubbl - it wa perfect ! my friend got the coconut milk tea w/ regular boba . her wa kind of wateri , but mine wa great . the atmospher in there wa weird ; the employe wa n't veri friendli . mayb it wa becaus we were liter the onli one in there . i do n't realli like the <unk> in there , despit all of the draw on the wall . the drink were good and decent price . i 'll be back !
i work downtown and had never discov the <unk> <unk> as a busi lunch venu until about six month ago . i like to experi a place a time or two befor review . after three visit , i must say that thi place is worth your time . servic is <unk> ( i ran out of water three time ) but the food is quit good and uniqu <unk> with southwest <unk> .
all i can say is <unk> . great sangria and have the bruschetta sampler to share . hummu one is my favorit . per other review i had the shrimp taco and they live up to the reput . they are great . finish everyth off with coconut <unk> and anoth sangria
the food wa fresh , healthi and fill . i have been there three time sinc they open . each time , i give the food five star . howev , everytim after i order , at each station , i have to constantli repeat my order back to the worker and thi is veri annoy when you have order <unk> meal `` ye , i order two kid meal , one with chicken strip , and fruit cup , and one with soup and fruit cup , and i order the italian club with soup , and my husband order pull pork , and etc '' ... at each station ... . ye , i did thi everytim i stop in . mayb a suggest is to do what <unk> doe , is take your order at the first regist ( instal a regist at the order counter mayb ? ) and cash you out at the end , thi way , employe are n't ask you at everi station `` what did you order ? '' and they have some sort of direct in the back unfortun when you are hungri and <unk> alreadi by the third time an employe ask you what you order , i want to reach over the counter and pick up my order myself , and move it to cash out . the flow need a bit more <unk> but otherwis i am still a fan of the food . 5 star for the food <unk> i do like light meal , not huge portion , so it perfect for me . 3 star for the lack of organ behind the counter but good effort .
thi <unk> 's locat recent open ... and it feel it . walk in i wa immedi greet with 2 larg tabl of scream kid . <unk> the front bar area should have a <unk> from the main dine seat so adult custom can have their own space . coupl thi with <unk> order and all the server <unk> around the bar ... <unk> the front of hous current <unk> in pure chao . not a space i will frequent unless the owner can iron that out . get past the front door the chicago style pizza tast realli good and they have a nice select of craft beer on tap . i 'll be back .
i wa pleasantli surpris ! my husband and i stop by to check it out and have dinner . veri yummi , with a great price to go along with it . we play a littl bit and had some cocktail . the bartend were veri nice , great person . <unk> wa funni and made great drink . i would recommend thi place to anyon look for a relax night out .
the food and servic is great ! the guy behind the counter do food prep wa gener with hi sampl and veri person . the ladi who rang up our order could n't have been more kind . we had gyro , grill chicken salad ( juici chicken and a yummi sauc ! ) and <unk> ... all veri delici and veri well made . love thi place ! howev : pain slow ! i 'm sure that 's becaus it 's freshli made , and i 'm in a hurri today , therefor i wo n't complain about it . just know that our simpl two person order took 25 minut , which for a mall food court , is pretti slow . not <unk> to eat when you 're on a time <unk> . so come a but earli and enjoy the excel food here ! we will definit be back . : )
we came here on a monday night and had a lot of fun . it wa a littl hard to find becaus it wa down the hallway , but it wa kind of nice that it wa in a separ area than the casino . onc we were in line , they were pretti effici with check guest list and get us insid . onc we were insid , we grab some drink and head to the danc floor . it wa nice that they had a dedic area in the middl just for peopl who want to danc . there were quit a few peopl , but it wa n't <unk> . it wa easi to spot the restroom and to make your way over to them from the danc floor . and the place had great <unk> , so it did n't get hot insid the club . the first dj wa pretti good . then anoth dj start a set , and we were n't feel it , so we left . my one complaint wa that we had to walk quit a way to get to the taxi stand to get a taxi back to our hotel .
we dine a few more time here and the food is still great . the <unk> is realli a bargain and plenti of food for two even when split into a half order . some tabl are locat near ceil speaker and the music is live so that might not be for everyon .
want to grab a bite and some drink while watch the <unk> game . the <unk> wa close so we went here . first impress wa good . we were greet by our bartend chri and ask what we were have and if we were hungri . chri introduc himself and hi partner behind the bar <unk> . drink came , food came , good night right ? thi chang as we wait 25 minut for a anoth drink . i had two drink over the cours of three quarter of <unk> and had to ask for the second . the bar wa n't pack at all and yet it seem <unk> to get a drink . thi wa until we had no plate , no drink and were wait for our friend to finish hi 3rd beer , which he had excel servic throughout the night . not say <unk> and chri are bad bartend , everyon ha an off night . just concern as we were told thi place wa good to go . the highlight of the even wa our `` chef '' who kept check on us and had a great person interact with us all night .
okay i walk in and wa pretti confus about what to do , thi be my first time at a jason 's deli . thank god i my friend had been there befor and direct me to the small cashier booth near the back of the place so we could place our order . there 's a pretti divers choic of sandwich , soup , and salad here . also there 's free soft serv ice cream . who doe n't love free ice cream ? ! our order came out fast , but i ask for no tomato and end up pick them out of my sandwich . also when i order a sandwich toast i kind of expect the insid to not be cold . it kind of throw off the whole textur for me , you know ? that be said their sandwich are huge ! it wa almost too much meat stuf into the slice of bread , becaus i had to take bite from each side so that it would n't slip out . the ambianc i would describ as noisi , and corpor . that 's not realli an issu though when you are just grab a quick bite befor head to a parti as i wa do , but for sit down and enjoy the surround i 'd recommend somewher els .
pretti good pizza for a quick bite . same concept as chipotl , subway or cafe rio . choos what you 'd like , they make it in front of you and then cook it quickli . we order a caesar salad and a chicken bbq pizza . the crust wa thin and crunchi with a littl char you come to know and love like your local <unk> , the bbq sauc wa flavor and sweet and we receiv it all in a time manner . i would n't recommend order from thi place for take out . i think their food is better eaten on site . it wa a bargain for less than $ 20 . i think one pizza and a salad for two peopl wa just the right amount of food .
thi gym is alway clean . front desk staff are courteou and help . bodi pump class rock !
thi is a place to go when you want to drink and watch game . the servic if you 're a girl is n't great and if you 're a guy is n't great , but the <unk> should <unk> you from crappi servic . my brother did n't get hi food for an hour and my avocado burger wa ok . the fri are disappoint sinc i love fri so much . on game day the park is n't free , it 's $ 10 per car . they would n't chang the game that were on due to their `` sunday polici '' that make them leav all the game on the whole time even if the crowd did n't want it . overal , it 's not bad if you want to watch game and drink beer .
note thi store is now locat on <unk> street just south of <unk> . owner is a realli nice guy , veri help for a person like me who know not much about cigar . nice laid out store , veri pleasant place to drop by . recommend !
i recent move to <unk> and <unk> have to find anoth hair <unk> . my thick black hair is not easi to cut properli , especi how i like it . so after find thi place i decid to <unk> tri it out . the result ? right on the mark with the first tri . i wa veri impress with how quickli <unk> , the hair <unk> and owner , deliv exactli what i ask for . no more <unk> . i 'll be come back again .
18 day and count with no word as to when our stuff will arriv ... <unk> to get someon to call you back is almost imposs . i hope the <unk> i 'm read are not true but i 'm start to have my doubt .
i have gone here for 9 straight year . the servic is top notch . when you come in they seat you right away , and the server alway check on your tabl everi 5 minut . the menu is great , so mani select to choos from . the food is fresh and outstand ! you should tri the <unk> `` french onion soup '' . what a amaz select of ipa beer they also have . i also love the decor . they serv lunch and dinner . highli recommend ! ! !
went back here recent with friend in town who love indian food . the food wa excel as alway . we order 4 naan and about 5 entre , and enjoy them all <unk> . the <unk> naan wa thick and fill with tasti . the <unk> naan for dessert remain one of our favorit . we also enjoy a <unk> , and some other vegetarian option . my friend ask them to cook the <unk> in oil instead of butter and they happili oblig . regard some of the 1 review wonder who complain about how terribl the servic is or how they have gotten sick ... i have eaten here at least 15 time and neither myself or anyon with me ha ever gotten even a mild upset stomach , and the servic is alway friendli and good . for those who miss the <unk> <unk> ( as i do ) ... the waiter told us ( might be the owner ) that they are plan to return to <unk> , so watch for it i guess . also ... i print out a coupon from <unk> ( i think that the site ... googl <unk> flavor of <unk> coupon ) ... it is the site that run those <unk> of coupon you get in the mail everi coupl of month or so . anyway , you can print the coupon from the site directli and take it <unk> wa $ 10 off 40 or 1 entre free with 1 purchas with 2 drink . it is n't <unk> , but it help .

went here for dinner on a weekday night , we first order the lettuc wrap and the <unk> salad for appet which tast great . for dinner our parti of 3 order the <unk> wrap , the bbq brick chicken and the bbq chicken pizza . unfortun , the pizza did not tast veri good , but the staff wa excel in chang our order and brought us the warm steak salad instead which tast great ! smash ha an impress staff and a divers menu , definit a place to check out in the gta
i realli enjoy thi studio . i went for a <unk> class and it start veri promptli at 5pm . the instructor wa good and veri nice but not as warm as most yoga instructor , possibl more <unk> . she wa still veri effect though and i felt great at the end of the hour . i also realli enjoy their store . they had great book on yoga and <unk> along with dozen of stone , <unk> , <unk> , and all kind of <unk> <unk> for <unk> your <unk> <unk> . there 's no place in calgari like it that i know of . when i mention to the <unk> that i did n't even know the store exist all thi time she repli `` that 's becaus you were meant to find it in your own divin time '' . i love that . they also have custom park in the back which is a huge plu sinc it 's locat on 17th ave <unk> worth check out for sure .
